Surely, this is no ordinary chess book that you hold, dear Reader.
Myself, I have read chess books that were entertaining, and those
that were instructive; some that were historic, and a few that were
downright bad. But never have I encountered a book written with such
powerful style and such obvious passion for the game.


The passion is infectious. The translation you hold is the final pro-
duct of ten years' work and four revisions — and still, I feel that it
wanted more effort...so you can see the fascination Bronstein's book
had for its translator! If my translation can infect you, the Reader,
with half of that fascination, then it will be a job well done.


I must thank Jack O'Keefe for his meticulous proofreading and price-
less editorial work.

INSTEAD OF A PREFACE


As I began work on my first chess book, I put myself mentally in the
reader's place, recalling the excitement with which I used to open each
new chess book, hoping to find vital thinking there, clear words, and
a wondrous tale of the art of chess. I absorbed a great deal from
books, and to this day I cherish the memory of the best of them.


Books about chess tournaments belong to a special class of litera-
ture, which would seem at first blush to be rather restrictive of the
author's creative possibilities, since he must write, not on themes of
his own choosing, but about chess material already created. But this is
not quite true. The author is free to treat the games any way he wishes,
to make generalizations, and to uncover the ideas and plans actually ex-
ecuted, as well as those that could have occurred in the actual or some
other game.


The book of a strong tournament is more than just a games collection.
When its participants are the world's strongest players, then the games
are mutually interdependent, and brimming with ideas, which crystallize
and develop as the event progresses. Thus, the tournament as a whole
represents a step forward in the development of chess creativity. We
may take as examples of such tournaments the events at Hastings 1895,
St Petersburg 1914, New York 1924, Moscow 1935, and Groningen 1946. Be-
yond doubt, Zurich-Neuhausen 1953 deserves a place among them.


In working on this book, I started from the premise that every full-
bodied game of chess is an artistic endeavor, arising out of a struggle
between two masters of equal rank. The kernel of a game of chess is the
creative clash of plans, the battle of chess ideas, which takes on its
highest form in the middlegame.


This book examines a number of standard positions which occur as a
result of the collision of plans; also examined are such strategic con-
cepts as darksquare weaknesses, the advantage of the two bishops, play
and counterplay on opposite wings, the relative strengths of the pieces,
overprotection, and so forth. Such elements of the struggle as intui-
tion, resourcefulness, and determination are discussed too.


The games of a tournament of grandmasters bring the reader into the
creative circle of the contemporary leaders of chess, showing him the
rise and fall of battle as well as the manner in which a game of chess
is created. It is the author's intention to discourse upon the least ex-
plored and most interesting stage of the game: the middlegame, and the
way it is handled by today’s grandmasters. That is the basic aim of
this book.


The author has tried to avoid weighing down his book with variations.
Variations can be interesting, if they show the beauty of chess; they
become useless when they exceed the limits of what a man can calculate;
and they are a real evil when they are substituted for the study and
clarification of positions in which the outcome is decided by intuition,
fantasy and talent.


Along with this, it was my hope that the player who read this book
would raise himself thereby to a rather higher level of playing strength.


The reader will see errors, too, in the games of this tournament; but
he will not be too severe in his judgment of the masters if he pictures
to himself the peculiar nature of the chess struggle. At the board there
sits a living person, with all his everyday thoughts and worries, some-
times far removed from chess. While selecting his plan, or even his next
move, he cannot help thinking about his standing in the tournament, re-
membering yesterday's result, looking at other games. A game is not an
analysis: everything must be worked out in one's head, without moving
the pieces, without consulting a book or asking advice from anyone...


Iv]


The grandmaster thinks and thinks — one last look at the clock —
"Time to decide; I'll risk it!" — and the knight goes to e5. Of course
it's easy, a whole year later, after studying all of the analyses and
spending days on the position, to tell the reader, with absolute cer-
tainty:"A mistake; the careful Nel was to be preferred..."


It may be that mistakes will turn up in my analyses and evaluations
as well, although I have tried to keep them to a minimum. It is my
hope that the reader will be indulgent, and help me to correct them.


It is with trepidation, then, that I submit my work to the judgment
of the readers. I will consider my ends achieved if the contents of this
book expand the reader's chess horizon, increase his mastery of the game,
give him some idea of the state of the art, and help him more fully to
value — and still more to love — the depths of chess.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION


Now that my book is ready for its second edition, I would like to
explain today what I had to pass over in the preface to the first edi-
tion four years ago. The work I submitted to the readers' judgment at
that time was a work which had little in common with the commentaries usu-~
ally seen in the chess press. “Rotework" isa thing abhorrent to art and lit-
erature alike; thus, it should be still less acceptable in chess, which ac-
tually falls somewhere in an intermediate zone between art and litera-
ture. I do not wish to say anything against the numerous tournament and
reference books that are being published, but for some years now a con-
siderable decline has been noticed in the appetite of chessplayers for
this type of literature, and yesterday's insatiable demand has slack-
ened. Under these circumstances, how would the public accept a large
and unfortunately rather expensive tournament book, such as this one?


I had no wish to become a variations-monger; nor did I want the role
of annotator-cum-guide. I felt that the author's ideas and conclusions
should form the basis of this book, with the moves played in each game
serving to annotate them, as it were. I tried to let the book's contents
display the richness and limitless expanse of chess ideas, and to let
the format resemble that of a literary work.


To judge from all the accepted indicators, the author appears to have
accomplished his purpose, at least in part: the book sold out very
quickly, and the reviews were favorable. Most valuable to me, however,
were the many letters and opinions I received from readers (and I re-
gret not having answered nearly enough of them). There I found, along
with justified criticism of my book's shortcomings, approval of the
basic principles by which it was written. Those letters have been the
finest possible reward for my labors, and I should like to take this
opportunity to offer my heartfelt thanks to all who wrote me. I should
like especially to thank Peter Romanovsky for his detailed review
(helpful to readers and the author alike) which appeared in "Shakhmaty
v SSSR".


I was happy to agree to the publishers" suggestion of a second edi-
tion; I intended to excise all obsolete and unimportant materials, to
develop other material a bit more fully, and to expand the preface to
reflect the most recent developments in the world of chess.


Thus, this second edition devotes a great deal less space to text, in
games which did not serve my purpose of uncovering and describing the
ideas of the art of chess. This applies especially to games from the
later rounds, when the final standings of the tournament had already
been largely determined, and the tension had slackened somewhat. Addi-
tionally, two or three errors in analysis, discovered by the readers
and the author, have been corrected; the proofreading has been up-
graded, and some diagrams revised.


I would like to close this segment with the hope that in the future
my chessplaying audience will continue to aid the author in his work
with their alert criticism, as well as their words of praise.


RRR


Since this is a book devoted mainly to the middle phase of the game
of chess, it might be appropriate to begin with a few words about the
evolution of opening ideas and the modern openings repertoire.


In former times — shall we say, the latter half of the preceding
century — a game generally opened with the king's pawn, to which
Black would, in the majority of cases, reply 1..e7-e5. Such defenses
as the Sicilian and the French were also employed, of course, but less
frequently. With some exceptions, over half of the games played in any
tournament would be open games, and sometimes a much greater percentage
than that. At the close of the last century and the beginning of the


{vii]


present one, the closed games for White and the semi-open games for
Black became very popular. Thus, in the Cambridge Springs tournament

of 1904, the Queen's Gambit was the most common opening, with the Ruy
Lopez second and the Sicilian third. The Indian defenses also began to
appear in the tournaments of the 1890's and 1900's: these were the har-
bingers of new ideas.


The 1920's witnessed the almost total disappearance of the open games,
with the exception of the Ruy Lopez, from important tournaments, and
the rise of the Queen's Gambit and other Queen's Pawn games. White's
success with the Queen's Gambit and the Ruy led gradually to the pop-
ularization of the asymmetrical defensive systems: the Indian against
1 d2-d4, and the Sicilian against 1 e2-e4. This was a very fruitful
period for the development of opening ideas. The victories of the young
grandmasters were closely bound up with their discovery of new openings:
the Nimzo-Indian, Reti's Opening, Grunfeld's Defense, Alekhine's De-
fense.


At the strong double-round tournament at Bled 1931, which included
Alekhine, Bogolyubov, Nimzovich, Vidmar, Flohr, Tartakover, Spielmann
and Maroczy, among others, 77 Queen's Gambits and other Queen s Pawn
games were played; of these, White won 29, and Black only 13. In the
same event, 21 games used Indian Defenses, of which White could win only
2, while losing 14. Is in any wonder that, in the era that followed, en-
compassing the 1930's and 1940's, fewer and fewer Queen's Gambits would
be seen? The careers of many Soviet and non-Soviet players owed a great
deal to the creation and development of new systems in the King's Indian
and Sicilian, as well as in the Nimzo-Indian and Grunfeld Defenses. To-
day, one may separate all openings, Black and White, into three major
groupings.


In the first grouping, both sides follow classical principles, devel-
oping pieces, occupying space, creating a pawn center, avoiding weak-
nesses, etc. This is the shape of the struggle in the great majority of
variations of the Queen's Gambit, Ruy Lopez, French, and some systems
of the Sicilian and Nimzo-Indian Defenses. Black knows that in these
variations, especially in symmetrical positions, the advantage of the
first move counts heavily, and he faces a long and patient struggle for
equality. He has few winning chances, but if he works hard and plays
cautiously, he may get a draw. The results of the World Championship
match between Capablanca and Alekhine may be taken as typical for such
openings. Of the thirty-four games of that match, thirty-three opened
with the queen's pawn; twenty-five games were drawn, White won six, and
Black two. Masters nowadays tend to avoid such openings, shunning sym-
metrical setups in favor of defenses which offer counterchances.


Thus we come to the second group of openings, in which one side fol-
lows classical principles, while the other side consciously flouts a
few, in order to obtain active play for his pieces, or an attack on the
enemy pawn center, or sometimes simply for the sake of complicating.
Such are the main lines of the King's Indian, Sicilian, Grunfeld and
Nimzo-Indian, and some forcing lines of the Queen's Gambit.


To the third group we may assign those openings in which White uses
the opening phase not to occupy, but to control, the center squares,
avoiding early definition of the pawn structure, and retaining maxi-
mum flexibility, while preparing for a war of maneuver. While this is
going on, White is ready to stir up complications at an appropriate
moment, or — should he secure some positional plus — to boil the game
down to a technical stage. This group comprises the Closed Variation of
the Sicilian, a number of lines in the Reti, the English, the King's
Indian Reversed, and a few others.


It should be noted here that giving an opening a name does not auto-
matically set the course of the opening struggle. For example: in the
Queen's Gambit, one may play the Orthodox Defense, which is a typical
form of the struggle on a classical footing. But one may also play Bot-


[viii]


vinnik's line, or the risky "Peruvian" variation, with forcing play and
counterchances for Black. The Queen's Indian is not one of the symmet-
rical openings, but it does not give Black any real counterchances at
all. And the Nimzo-Indian, one of the most outstanding and hardiest of
defenses the “Hypermodern" school of the 1920's ever produced, allows
-a flexible transition either to positional schemes or to sharp varia-
tions.

These changes in our conception of the opening closely paralleled the
development of chess ideas in general. The Queen's Gambit's greatest
popularity coincided with the period when chess was completely dominated
by the principles of the positional school. With all the good these
principles have done, their one major shortcoming must be pointed out:
the evaluation of positions by externals alone. In the eyes of Tarrasch's
disciples — and he was the propagandist of Steinitz' ideas — such fac-
tors as a backward pawn, or a powerful pawn center, or an advantage in
development, were decisive, bothin the evaluation of one's own position
and in setting up a plan of action. "If one piece stands poorly, the
whole game stands poorly," said Tarrasch. The principles of the posi-
tional school, expressed in simple instructional form by Tarrasch, be-
came inviolable axioms of chess to many of his contemporaries. And thus
arose the misconception, which persists to this day, of the so-called
"consistent" game, in which one player carries out, from beginning to
end, his logical plan, almost as if he were demonstrating a theorem of
geometry.


In the annotations to such an "ideal" game, one player always appears
as the keeper of principle, the other as its transgressor. The "good"
player then accumulates positional advantages and places them in avault,
much as if he were saving to buy a motorcycle. Having accumulated the
proper amount, he then launches a combinative attack, winding it up with
an instructive mate, or with a still more instructive win of the ex-
change. And just what, you may ask, was his opponent doing all this
time? Why, gazing phlegmatically at his backward pawns and poorly-placed
pieces, shrugging his shoulders, and then finally: "Black resigns."


I doubt if it needs to be demonstrated that such games never occur be-
tween two grandmasters of equal ability, and that the annotators— a
role generally assumed by the winner — turned what they wished to be
into what actually happened.


The views of the positional school held sway in chess for a long time,
but their weak side came to light in the 1920's. As the Queen's Gambit
began to fade from the openings lists, so the names of Nimzovich, Reti,
Tartakover and other masters began to appear more and more frequently
at the top of tournament crosstables, while these players came out
strongly against one-sided understanding and exaggeration of the role
of positional principles.


Around 1935, the young masters of our country made their internation:
al debut, with Botvinnik at their head; later, they were to advance to
the forefront of the world's players. Their continuing successes gave
some observers the impression of a Soviet school of chess, some sort of
aggregate of identical chess ideas and views. I don't find this to be
entirely true. As a matter of fact, the Soviet family of chess masters
includes players of the most diverse styles. For example, Spassky and
Petrosian, to judge from their styles of play and differing conceptions
of the game, are as unlike one another as were Spielmann and Schlechter;
and Tal as is far removed from Botvinnik as Lasker was from Capablanca.


Now, what sort of ideas characterize the 1950's? What contribution did
this tournament in Switzerland make to the development of -these ideas?
And what is to be the direction of further progress in chess?


First, let us note the great erudition of chessplayers who have ab-
sorbed the experience of previous generations, allowing them now to


[ix]


fight with still more courage, forethought, fantasy and risk — all
based on sober assessment of the pros and cons of the intended oper-
ation.


Our understanding of positional play has matured immeasurably. Where
Tarrasch taught us to avoid weaknesses in our own position while striv-
ing to create them in our opponent's position, to accumulate small ad-
vantages, to occupy open lines, and never to begin an attack without
sufficient grounds, today things are sometimes done altogether differ-
ently. We might give ourselves weak spots and weak pawns, in order to
distract our opponent; give up open lines, in order to save the rooks
for other, more promising plans; or mount an attacking demonstration,
in order to hide our real intentions.


The number of standard defensible positions, which every chessplay-
er knows he can fall back on in case of need, has also grown by leaps
and bounds. We now find that many positions which were formerly consid-
ered lost can be defended successfully, even actively; but this requires,
firstly: a tense game of calculation, and secondly: the ability to per-
ceive the proper moment to abandon the weakness to its fate and carry
the fight to a new sector. Only now has it become clear that this was
precisely Emanuel Lasker's standard approach to the game, and that one
of his major advantages over his rivals lay in the fact that none of
them understood it.


On the other hand, this approach was hardly Lasker's only distin-
guishing characteristic. He was the game's great psychologist, who knew
better than anyone how to make the pendulum of battle swing left, then
right, never overstepping the bounds of safety himself, while impercep-
tibly goading his opponent over the edge. He would deliberately play
second-rate moves, practically inviting his orthodox opponent to punish
him. Nowadays, even this style has been analyzed and superseded. Today's
players are ready at times to give their opponents what would appear to
be a positional advantage from the very first moves.


Clear examples of this are the positions that arise in the King's In-
dian after ..e5:d4, as well as the group of positions after 1 d4 Nf6
2 c4 cS 3 a5 e6 4 Nc3 ed 5 cd. The Boleslavsky Variation of the Sici-
lian, with its gaping hole at d5 and the hopelessly backward pawn on
d6, might seem unbelievably daring, but nonetheless it withstands ev-
ery assault. In this book, we will find a number of such examples.


The reader will also find here descriptions of the technical ways and
means employed by the contemporary master in the middlegame. The concept
of technique is much broader now than it was a few decades ago, and what
was once a rare occurrence, a lucky find, is now the tool of the masses.


Without technique, one cannot attain mastery of any form; it is no
less impossible in chess.


However, the importance of technique in chess should not be exagger~
ated, either. The end phase of the game, frequently described as “a
matter of technique", is certainly not always that clear and simple.
Thirty years ago, Capablanca was considered the greatest technical
player in the world; today it is Smyslov. After analysis of the so-
called technical games of Capablanca and Smyslov, I concluded that they
are based on the combinative element and on far-seeing and accurate an-
alysis, and that as a consequence their technique is of an unusually
high order. The same could be said, to a greater or lesser degree, of
the endgames played by many grandmasters. I will mention only two here
from this tournament: Euwe's against Stahlberg, and Gligoric’s against
Euwe.


Another characteristic quality of the contemporary creative output,
which the reader will note more than once in the games of this tour-
nament, is a readiness to react instantly to any change in the oppo-
nent's plans, and to make radical alterations in one's own plan, if


[x]


given sufficient justification.


One of the most prominent — and promising — tendencies which came
forward in the course of this tournament was a penchant for wide-open
piece play almost from the first moves. Apparently Morphy's style re-
tains an irresistible fascination for chessplayers in every age, and a
return to this style, refined perhaps to a higher level, is the dream
of all players, grandmasters included. To me, it appears that we are
closer to this ideal now than we have been at any time in the past cen-
tury.


This new tendency, whose representatives have blazed a trail through
the USSR Championships, the 1955 and 1958 Interzonal tournaments, and
the 1959 Candidates’ tournament, is characterized by an effort to take
the game out of its logical channels at any cost, redirecting it into
the combinative — or, more accurately, the calculative. The material
side of the question — a pawn more or an exchange less — has no spe~
cial significance. There is absolutely no need to demonstrate the com-
bination's correctness in every variation. More likely the reverse may
be true: in the majority of cases, it turns out that the defending side
could have held out by finding a series of saving moves. But here the
New Wave grandmaster trusts in himself and in his phenomenal ability to
calculate a vast number of long and complicated variations.


Sometimes this can give the game a very strange turn indeed. As one
positional master said, "I fought him (a master of the calculative
style) for thirty-two moves, and never guessed his reply, except once,
when he had to take my queen."


The foremost advocates of this dynamic style today are undoubtedly
Mikhail Tal and Boris Spassky. Of course, complicating and turning the
game into a war of calculation are not the only weapons in the arsenal
of these unusually talented and well-rounded players. They are past
masters of the techniques of positional play, conduct brilliant endgames,
know the openings well, and surpass other masters precisely in their
skill at giving the game a dynamic twist, making it the sort of game
which is absolutely impossible to evaluate by landmarks; willy-nilly,
one must then play "move by move", or perhaps even "variation by var-
iation".


The time came for one of them to try his mettle, and the viability of
his personal style, in single combat against the most powerful player of
the past two decades: Mikhail Moiseevich Botvinnik. The results of that
encounter and of the tournaments that led to it show, first of all, that
in Mikhail Nekhemevich Tal we have the representative of a definite new
direction; and second, that the existence of this direction does not by
any stretch of the imagination signify an end to the kind of chess strug-
gle that is based not only on the computation of variations, but on
logic and principle as well.


The author of this book, in the course of his twenty-year life in
chess, has played quite a few sharp, tense games, where he had to bal-
ance for a while on a sword edge; but I would certainly be the last to
conclude that chess consists solely of calculating variations. And I
would hope that, rather than see the further course of chess history
bear out such a conclusion, the new style of play will instead become
but one of many elements in the arsenal of creative techniques that are
comprised in the art of chess.

ROUND ONE


1. Szabo—Geller
(Catalan Opening)


I have long suspected, when-
ever the books I have read began
discussing darksquare weaknesses
or an attack on the dark squares,
that the subject under discussion
was not only beyond my understan-
ding, but beyond the author's as
well. "Certainly,", I would say
to myself, "it must be true that
the enemy dark squares will be
weak if his pawns stand on light
squares and he loses his dark-
square bishop. But if he then
removes all of his pieces from
the dark squares, what will be
left for me to attack?"


Such was my line of reasoning,
until the day I realized that a
weakness of the dark squares is
also a weakness of the pieces and
pawns on the light squares. Light-
square weaknesses are also possi-
ble, resulting in a weakening of
the enemy pieces and pawns onthe
dark squares — as occurred, for
example, in the Geller - Najdorf
game in Round 13. The point of an
attack on the dark squares is
that, by placing my pawns and
pieces on the dark, I attack my
opponent's pieces and pawns on
the light.


The Szabo - Geller game pro-
vides a clear example of the me-
thod of exploiting a darksquare
weakness; and the combination
which was possible after Black's
24th fairly begs to be included
in a textbook, taking place as
it does entirely on light squares.

Having hatched a plan to weak-

undertakes a delicate maneuver
aimed at bringing about the ex-
change of the darksquare bishops,
which will further strengthen
his grip on the dark squares.

A small but serious inaccuracy:
Black removes this piece fromthe
main theater of operations. Addi-
tionally, the combination 17 N:b5
ab 18 b4 now becomes possible, due
to the insufficiently protected
rook at c8. Szabo, however, con-
tinues with his plan, fixing the
pawns at a6 and b5S on their light
squares. 16.. Nb6 would have been
much better for Black: increasing
his control of c4 would have made
it more difficult for White to
decide, on b2-b4.

Geller cannot take the c-file
away from his opponent, for if
21.. Rc8, White would simply take
the rook: 22 Q:c8+ B:c8 23 R:c8+
Ne8 24 Ne5!, and there is no
stopping 25 Bcé.

22. a2-a3 Nf6-d5

Seeing that White's position-
al squeeze could become very dan-
gerous, should he succeed in oc-
cupying the seventh rank or in
establishing his knight on c5,
Geller decides to complicate (his
move also stops both threats).


23. Qc3-d4 £7-£6
24. Nf3-el e6-e5
25. Qd4-c5 ies


A consistent, though rather un-
inspired, continuation. 25 Qa7!
would certainly have been much
prettier, retaining his hold on
the dark squares while attacking
the enemy pieces and pawns on the
light squares. Black would be un-
able to smoke the queen out, since
25..Ra8 would obviously fail ag-
ainst 26 B:d5+; while after
25..K£8 26 Nd3 Ra8 27 Qc5, the ex-
change of queens would bring the
white knight to c5. And finally,
25..Rd7 brings on an elegant lit-
tle combination: 26 Q:b7! If Black
takes the queen, then 27 B:d5+,
followed by 28 Rc8+ leads to the
complete extermination of Black's
pieces ~ curiously enough, all of
them perish on light squares.


Black may have intended to ans-
wer 25 Qa7 with 25..e4, and if
26 B:e4, not 26..N£4? (which would
be nicely refuted by 27 Bf3), but
simply 26..Q:e4 27 Q:b7 Q:e2, with
an unclear game. On 25..e4, how-
ever, White's bishop would leave
the blocked diagonal for an equ-
ally successful career on its
neighbor (with 26 Bh3).

ee Qe7:c5

White would have maintained a
clear advantage with 26 R:c5, but
Szabo probably thought that his
pin on the knight, combined with
his threat to advance the c-pawn
would assure him victory. However,
Black finds the defensive maneu-


ver ..Rd8-d7-e7.

Szabo declines the repetition,
although he no longer has the bet-
ter position. This is a psycho-
logical error common to chess-
players of all ranks from begin-
ner to grandmaster: to lose one's
objectivity is almost invariably


to lose the game as well.

(Nimzoindian Defense)

3. Nbiec3 BE8=-b4
4 e2-e3 oe


Aron Nimzovich, who invented
this defense, could hardly have
thought that thirty years later
the masters of chess still would
not have solved the basic prob-
lem: whether putting the ques-
tion to Black's bishop with an
immediate 4 a3 is good or bad.
Naturally, if we knew it to be
good, that would render all oth-
er tries pointless, to say the
least.


4. elie c7-c5
5. Bf1-d3 0-0
6. Ngi-£3 d7-d5


Nimzovich never used to ad-
vance his c-pawn to c5 without
need; he hoped that, after he
gave White doubled pawns by
means of the exchange at c3,
sooner or later he could induce
White to play d4-d5, after which
he could establish his knight at
c5. A lot of water has gone un-
der the bridge since, and the
modern master puts no great stock
in that far-off prospect of capi-
talizing on the doubled c-pawns.
Instead, the immediate counter-
attack on the center with every
means available has become one
of the standard ideas for Black
in the Nimzo-Indian.


hee 0-0 Nb8~-c6
8. a2-a3 Bb4:c3
9. b2:¢c3 d5:c4
10. Bd3:c4 Qd8-c7


Today, this position has been
studied as thoroughly as were the
Muzio and Evans Gambits acentury
ago. What are the basic features
of this position, and how does
the evaluation of those features
give rise to the further plans
for both sides?


The placement of White's pieces
radiates a great deal of poten-
tial energy, which ought to be


[3]


converted into kinetic — White
must set his center pawns in
motion, activating both his
rooks and his deeply-buried
darksquare bishop. The most
logical plan would seem to be
the advance of the e-pawn, first
to e4, and then to e5, todrive
Black's knight from £6 and lay
the groundwork for a kingside
attack.


Black in turn must either pre-
vent the e-pawn's advance or
counterattack the white pawn
center, which will lose some of
its solidity the moment the pawn
advances from e3 to e4.


In this game, Reshevsky com-
bines both of Black's ideas to
achieve a favorable disposition
of his forces, while Najdorf
does not put nearly enough vig-
or into the execution of his
plan.


Ets a3-a4


Of all the possible continu-
ations that have been used here,
this one may well be the least
logical: it resolves only one
minor problem, the development
of the queen's bishop— and to
a poor square, at that. The pawn
at c5 will find defenders eas-
ily enough, and the bishop will
find itself out of the action.
That outflung pawn at a4 will
not be a jewel in White's posi-
tion either.

Strategically, Black already
has a won game: the a-pawn is
falling, while White has yet to
find useful employment for his
bishops. In this difficult sit-
uation, Najdorf employs the res-
iliency of his position to work
up one last tactical try.


24. Nf3-h2


As time-pressure approaches,
the less strategy and the more
tactics.


24. eee Nd7-b6


How to meet the threat of
25..N:a4 is a question White was
never called upon to answer, be-
cause Reshevsky, having four mi-
nutes left to make his last 16
moves, offered a draw. Evidently
he was unable to calculate fully
the consequences of White's com-
bination 25 Ng4 N:a4 26 N:f6+ gf
27-Q:f6.


[4]


Right after the game, and later
in his published commentaries as
well, Najdorf showed that he had
a Sora ias draw: for example,
27.. N:b2 28 Bg4, and there is
no escaping the perpetual after
29 B:e6+ and 30 BESt+, etc. One
pretty variation is 28..Qg7

29 B:e6+ Kh7 30 B£5+ Kh8 31 Rd8+
R:d8 32 Q:d8+ Qg8 33 Qfo+t.


If Black had not taken the pawn
at move 25, playing 25..e5 in-
stead, then 26 Qc2 and 27 Qg6
also leads inevitably to a per-
petual check.


White would have had a harder
time if, instead of 24..Nb6,Black
had simply played 24..B:a4, leav-
ing the knight to defend the king
side. Now 25 Ng4 would not have
nearly the same effect, in view
of 25.. e5 26 Qc2 N£8. Another
possibility after 24..Nb6 25 Ng4
would be 25..Nd4; for example:

26 ed N:a4, etc. The aim of
25..Nd4 is to close off the c3-
£6 diagonal, thereby cancelling
out White's N:f6+ gf; Q:f6. Since
such variations are impossible to
calculate accurately in time-
pressure, Reshevsky preferred the

It was time to start thinking
about castling and developing
the rooks to support the further
advance of the pawns. One at-
tractive line, involving long
castling — 10..B:£3 11 B:f£3 e4
12 Bg2 h6 13 b3 Qd7 14 Bb2 0-0-0-—-
fails to come off, because on
the 11th move White recaptures,
not with the bishop, but with
the pawn, which he then advances
to £4, breaking up the enemy
center pawns. After the text
move, Black no longer has to
worry about an eventual b2-b4.

11. Bel-g5 BE8=-c5

Black sets up the threat of
12..e4, but grants White the
opportunity to stop this pawn
cold. After 11..Be/7!, White
would not have had this block-
ading opportunity. In order to
meet the threatened advance of
the e-pawn, White would have
been practically forced to make
the exchange on f6.


12. e2-e4 h7-h6
13. Bg5:f6 Qd8: £6
14. Ne2-el Qf6-e6


The most important point in
this position is unquestionably
d4: it marks the intersection
of the lines of force from the
black bishop to the white king
and from the black rook to the
white queen; also, if the black
knight could get to d4, it would
take away four squares from the
white queen and strengthen the
pin on the knight at £3. White's
next — and quite obvious — move
will reduce the value of this
communications nexus to a mini-
mum, if not to zero. The block-
aded d-pawn will frustrate both
the bishop on c5 and the rook on
a8 with its aspirations to d8.
The nexus could have been cleared
for the price of a pawn: 14..d3


[5]


would have given Black a very
promising game.

A pretty final stroke, based on
combinative motifs, to the defen-
sive system White has devised.

If Black exchanges queens and
continues with ..f7-f6, he will
lose: 19..Q:£5 20 ef £6 21 R:c6!
be 22 B:c6+ Kf7 23 Bd5+!, fol-
lowed by the capture of the rook
at a8. If, after exchanging
queens, Black defends the e-pawn
with his bishop instead, then
White has a positional advantage.
And if 19..Qd6, then 20 £4 g6

21 fe, or 20 Rc5 are strong.

it out to the 41st move and ad-
journs, hoping to find some hid-
den resource at his leisure.

Chigorin's System in the Ruy
Lopez is a frequent guest in in-
ternational competition, but it
appeared in Zurich only six
times. White marshals his forces
for a kingside attack which gen-
erally doesn't have much bite to
it, since today's grandmasters
have learned quite well how to
set up a defensible position.
Not surprisingly, therefore, most
of the games played with this
variation have lately been wind-
ing up drawn.

I find it hard to tie White's
last two moves in with his stra-
tegic plan: the bishop on d2 and
the rook on cl are not one whit
better placed than they were at
their original positions. After
this loss of two tempi, White's
diversion on the kingside can
have no serious future. Averbakh
decides to generate piece play
on this wing without taking on
additional responsibilities with
the advance of the g-pawn.

5. Taimanov—Bronstein
(Benoni Defense)


It's a difficult thing tomain-
tain objectivity when commenting
on one's own games. Variations
running in the commentator's fa-
vor are always interesting, so
details flow quick and plentiful
from the pen; variations which
favor one's opponent, however,
are often unclear as can be. For
one's own mistakes, one seeks
(and generally finds) justifi-
cation; while the opponent's er-
rors seem so natural as to need
no explanation whatever. So even
before beginning to comment on
my game from Round One, I feel
compelled to note that Black did
not have a decisive advantage
until very late in the game, al-
most the very end. Psychologic-
ally, White's loss can be traced
to the fact that he missed the


[7]


turning point of the game, at
which it was necessary for him
to begin giving serious thought
to the problem of how to get a
draw. As regards the purely
chessic reasons for his loss,
these I shall try to illuminate
in my notes.

4. Nbi-c3 d7-d6

What does Black achieve by
sacrificing a pawn? First, he
undermines the spearhead of the
white pawn chain, the pawn on
a5; in addition, after the un-
avoidable ..a7-a6 and b5:a6, he
obtains the good diagonal a6-f1
for his bishop, which would have
far fewer prospects along the
c8-h3 diagonal. The two open
files Black obtains on the queen-
side, allowing him active play
against White's a- and b-pawns,
also speak in favor of the sac-
rifice. Nor ought we to forget
Black's bishop at g7: since Black
intends to leave his e-pawn at e/7
in this system, the bishop's
sphere of activity is automatic-
ally increased. And finally,
there is the interesting strate-
gic idea (encountered also in
other variations of the King's
Indian) of developing the queen's
rook without moving it from its
original square.


Of course, the sacrifice has
its deficiencies as well, chief
among these being the pawn defi-
cit. Should White gradually suc-
ceed in overcoming all his diffi-
culties, and reach an endgame, he
will have excellent winning chan-
ces. It is for this last reason
that this variation was not seen
in any more games from this tour-
nament. I used it here, partly
because I did not want to begin
this tournament with the sort of
protracted defense Black is us-
ually forced to put up with in


one of the “normal™ lines.

Once I had precisely the same
position to play, but as White,
vs. Lundin at Stockholm, 1948. I
traded bishops, whereupon Black
recaptured at a6 with his knight,
which he then brought via c7 and
b5 to d&4. This seemed overly pro-
tracted to tte, so in the present
game I recaptured at a6 with my
rook, sending the queen's knight
via d7 and b6 to a4, trading off
the white queen's knight and
weakening the defense of the
pawns at a2 and b2.

Taimanov has decided on e4-e5,
cracking the foundation of the
Black position; but this proves
tactically unrealizable. White
would have had more prospects
with 11 B£4 and 13 Qd2, instead
of his 11 Rel and 13 Qe2: after-
wards, he could post his rooks
to cl and bl, with the idea of
gradually clearing all of his
pieces and pawns off the enemy
bishop's long diagonal. And af-
ter that, White would prepare
the advance b2-b4, beginning
the active realization of his
extra pawn. This is how I played
against Lundin, and I still con-
sider it to be the correct plan.

Black's endgame advantage is
founded on the fact that his base
pawn at e7 is close to home and
therefore easy to defend, while
the white pawns at c3 and e4 af-
ford excellent targets to Black's
rooks. If the e-pawn advances,
then the pawn on d5 becomes weak.
The following lines give an ap-

Black now has a weak pawn at
c5, and White could, for exam-

up his two queenside pawns for
Black's one, and the draw would


be assured,

however, is easier said than

The system Black has selected
is not without its drawbacks,
positionally speaking, but he
does possess several trumps: the
open e-file, good diagonals for
both his bishops, and three pawns
against two on the queenside. For
his part, White can usually esta-
blish a knight at c4, putting the
squeeze on the d-pawn, the key-
stone of Black's entire fortress.
In this game, Euwe decides he
would rather play on the queen-
side, creating weaknesses there
for occupation by his pieces. La-
ter, the game gets interesting,
thanks to bold play — bold to
the point of sacrifices— by both
sides.

A typical maneuver in this po-

jority by blockade; should Black
then play ..b7-b5, White's knight
gains access to a5 and cé.


Black activates his pieces, in-
tending to bring the knight on d?

..c5-c4 followed by ..Nd7-c5.


18. Qd1-b3


Halting Black's plan. White is
not worried about the loss of the
e-pawn, since he would obtain an
attack on the dark squares as com=
pensation: for instance, 18..B:c3
19 Q:c3 B:e2 20 Rfel Bb5 21 Bhé

Black had a strong move at his

cannot play 21 Q:b5 in view of
21..N:d5. After 18..Rab8, the
threat of 19..c4 would carry more
weight also.


The plan Black actually se-
lects is not as good: he intends
to sacrifice an exchange, hoping
to obtain complications.

Fifteen years ago, the King's
Indian Defense was played in So-
viet tournaments only by those
wishing to avoid the passive,
thoroughly analyzed variations
of the Queen's Gambit Declined;
outside our borders, it was hard-
ly played at all. As recently as
the 1948 World's Championship,
the King's Indian figured in on-
ly two games out of fifty. Here


[11]


in Zurich, one out of three games
opened with 1 d2-d4 turned into
a King's Indian, and foreign
players used it just as often as
ours did.


The diagrammed position is a
familiar one to theory; the text
move is one of the latest discov-
eries. Wishing to develop his
bishop to e3, White also over-
protects his e-pawn!


The knight at d4 is temporari-
ly undefended, of course, and
Black could win a center pawn by
12 ..Nf:e4 13 N:e4 B:d4; but then
it would be White's turn to move,
and he would seize the key square
f6 with 14 Bg5 Qd7 15 NE6+ B:£6
16 B:£6, removing Black's "In-
dian" bishop, without which all
Indian configurations become
pointless. The extra pawn would
be no consolation: occasional at-
tempts to prove otherwise have
nearly all wound up disastrously
for Black, so no one snaps at the
e-pawn anymore.

Characteristically, the King's
Indian Defense features a tense
battle waged on all fronts sim-
ultaneously. The system used here
secures White considerable terri-
tory, not only in the center, but
on the kingside as well.


I do not wish to leave the
reader the false impression that
White's further task, which is
to transform his sizable spatial
plus into a material advantage,
will be an easy one. The secret
of the King's Indian's hardihood
is that, while conceding space,
Black builds a few small but
weighty details into his config-
uration. Foremost among these are
his long-range bishops at g7 and
c8, his firmly entrenched knight
at c5 and the rook at e8, which
maintain constant watch on the e-
pawn. Nor ought we to forget his
pawns. The "weak" pawn on dé is
just waiting for the chance to
push to d5, so White must con-
tinually keep an eye on that. The
pawn at a4 also has an important
role: the threat to advance it to
a3 can upset his opponent's plans
for that sector at any time, so
White must take extra precautions


ae the defense of c3 and
c4. If 12 Qc2 was White's latest
theoretical discovery, then the
same might justifiably be said
of Black's 14..Nfd7. 14..Qa5 was
the old move, but after 15 Bf4,
either the bishop at g7 or the
rook at e8 had to move to an in-
ferior position, whereas now the
pawn can be covered with 15..Ne5.

Stahlberg decides to rid his
position once and for all of the
threat of a black pawn advance
to a3. This move deprives the
square b3 of pawn protection,
but it also strengthens the po-
sition of the pawn at b2 and
generally of the whole constel-
lation a3-b2-c3.


The next stage of the game =
roughly to move 30 — consists of
skillful maneuvers from both
sides, inducing weaknesses,
White's preparation for e4-e5
and Black's for ..d7-d5 or ..f7-
£5, and mutual prevention of
these breaks.

The next two moves are some-
what unusual, both for White
and for Black: Black concen-
trates maximum firepower against
the pawn at e4, an assault which
White tries to divert by threat-
ening to take on d6. It is en-
tirely characteristic that, in
order to carry out this idea,
White can find no better re-
treat square for his central-
ized knight at d4, the pride of
his position, than back to its
original square gl, since all
other retreat squares would in-
terfere, in one way or another,
with the coordination between
his pieces.


This seems an appropriate time
to impart to the reader the. sec-
ret of the d6-pawn in the King's
Indian Defense. This pawn, al-
though backward on an open file,
proves nevertheless a tough lit-


[12]


tle nut to crack, because it is
so hard to reach. It might seem
that nothing could be simpler
than dropping the knight back
from d4, but the problem is that
White needs his knight precisely
on d4, where it observes the
squares b5, c6, e6 and £5, and
neutralizes the power of the bi-
shop at g7. Only after White has
taken precautions against all of
Black's possible attacks (..a4-
a3, ..Bc8-e6, ..£7-f5) can his
knight allow itself to leave the
center; but meanwhile Black has
time to regroup.


So the weakness of the d6-pawn
turns out to be largely fictive.
Modern methods of opening play
allow for many such fictive weak
pawns, but it was precisely this
‘permanent™ weakness at d6 which
so long condemned the King's In-
dian to the list of dubious open-
ings.

24. Nf£3-g1

The knight will return, five
moves later, to help the pawn on
e4 cross the Rubicon. The pawn
could have been pushed at orce,
but that would have given up con-
trol of the £5 square; Black's
bishop could go there, and after
24 e5 B£5, White would have had
to sacrifice his queen by taking
the knight at £6 with his pawn —
but that would win for White. The
simple 24..de, on the other hand,
would give Black excellent play.


White could have taken the a-
pawn here, but at too great a
price: White needs his darksquare
bishop as much as Black does.


Boleslavsky's 24th move is an
invitation to White's rook tocap-
ture that long-disputed point at
last; after 25..Nb6, however,
Black's knight enters c4. Stahl-
berg's decision is most probably
the correct one: before proceed-
ing with the siege of the d-pawn,
he exchanges off the "Indian" bi-
shops.

The position appears basically
unchanged, but an important event





has taken place: the disappear-
ance of the darksquare bishops,
and of the pawns at c4 and d6.
With the bishops' disappearance,
both sides must now make some ad-
justments in their basic strate-
gies. Black, for example, must
give top priority to securing

his position on the long diago-
nal, and against the incursion

of a white pawn to f6 and queen
to h6. Considering the serious-
ness of this threat, Boleslavsky's
last move was a very good one:
the bishop is ready for action
on the a2-g8 diagonal, and the
f-pawn, by going to f6, covers
the king against any attacks

from the main road; the bishop
replaces the pawn at f7. White,
for his part, must punch a hole
in this new defensive line at any
cost, or else the initiative will
pass to his opponent, and all the
weaknesses in White's position,
which were of only passing int-
erest so long as he was on the
offensive (b3, the lack of pawn
control of d3, c3 and f3, and

the passive bishop at g2), might
become the basis for combinations.

Stahlberg is a consummate tac-

is in his style. White cannot be

In the heat of battle, Bole-
slavsky disregards his fierce
time-pressure and declines the
draw he could probably have se-
cured by means of the accurate
retreat 35..Qc/7, Crees aga-
inst both threats, 36 Q:f/ and
36 Qf6+. Black's dream of capi-
talizing on his extra pawn is
impractical, considering his ex-
posed king. Even if Black should
successfully run the gauntlet,
warding off all assaults, White
could still, in all probability,
find a perpetual check.


36. Q£2-d4+
White's task is now partially


complete: the queen has attained
the long diagonal.


36. eee Kg7-g8
37. RE£1:£5 go:£5
38. Qd4-e5 diese


Judging from his next two
moves, it seems quite likely that
Black simply overlooked this mod-
est little move, which shakes his
position to its foundations.

38. Qa5-b6!

The pin on the knight must be

liquidated at once. The threat


was not so much 39 Q:f5 as 39 g4,
and if 39.. fg 40 Ne4. With this
timely retreat of his queen to
b6, Black avoids the worst. At-
tempting to save his f-pawn by
38.. Bg6 might have had tragic
consequences, since besides 39 g4,
White could also have exploited
the new pin motif to drive the
black king into a mating net al-
most by force: 39 Bf1 Qb6 40 Bc4+
K£8 41 Qf6+ Ke8 42 Nd5 — such
variations are certainly not for
time-pressure. Now White restores
the material balance, and Black's
king is in as much danger as be-
fore.


39. Qe5:£5 BE7-g6
40. Qf5-e5 Nc5-d3


Black uses his last move before
the time control to remind White
that there are targets in his own
camp too. Black's queen is ready
to take the b-pawn, or, circum-
stances permitting, to enter at
£2 with the threat of ..Nel.

This was the move Black wrote on
his scoresheet, then sealed inthe
envelope which was handed to the
chief arbiter of the tournament.
Stahlberg, of course, without any
knowledge of that sealed move, had
to analyze both of Black's possi-
ble replies, 41.. Kg7 and .. Bf7.


42. Qe6-e7+


When he adjourned, Boleslavsky
considered the possibility 42 Nd5,


but felt that after 42.. Q:b2
White would have, at most, a
perpetual check. This powerful
move, however, changes matters
completely. Black cannot retreat
to g8, since 43 Nd5 would follow;
so the bishop has to interpose,
but then the knight can enter d6
via e4. So 41.. B£7 was a better
move than 41.. Kg7: White could
give perpetual check or win the
a-pawn with 42 Qg4+, but this
would be fully compensated by

the black queen's entry into £2.
The most likely outcome would then
be a draw. Well, the game was a
draw here, too, but only after
some interesting new adventures.

the threat with the surprising

4. Nb1-c3 Bf8-e7
5. c4:d5 e6:d5


White usually enters the Ex-
change Variation of the Orthodox
Queen's Gambit with the intention
of playing a minority attack, in
which he stations his rooks onthe
b- and c-files, and then advances
his b-pawn and trades it off onc6
to create a backward black pawn.

A number of master games have dem-
onstrated that this is too direct
a plan to pose any great danger to
Black, who may, in his turn, ex-
pand upon his control of the e-
file to carry an active piece game
to the kingside, establishing ap-
proximate equality.


For this game, Kotov is not af-
ter a draw: he has other reasons
altogether for trading off the
center pawns. In the tradition of
the old masters, he intends cast-
ling long, followed by a kingside
pawn storm <- an idea he conceals
quite well for the next 5-7 moves.

Black's last five moves are all
part of one plan. Stahlberg is


[15]


perhaps the only grandmaster of
our day who retains the Orthodox
Defense as part of his repertoire,
and he plays it like a virtuoso.
This system, with 7.. g6 and the
knight transfer to e6 prior to
castling, is his invention. Nei-
ther Kotov, in the present game,
nor the author, in the tourna-
ment's second half, nor even the
World Champion, Botvinnik him-
self, in the Budapest tournament
of 1952, could find any weak spot
in the Swedish grandmaster's fav-
orite defense.

his true intentions are revealed.

sides prefer the new situation,

because he has a new open file,
and the pawn is closer to the
center; and Black, because he
need no longer fear the pawn

pawns are equal for the moment,
and White's rook is unapproach-

9. Geller—Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense)


One of the tournament's best
games, and the recipient of a
brilliancy prize. White initia-
ted a powerful attack on the king
by sacrificing his c4-pawn, This
attack gave Geller every hope of
success, provided Black held to
the traditional sort of queen-
side counterattack. Euwe, how-
ever, carried out two remarkable
ideas: 1) utilizing his queen-
side lines of communication for
an attack on the king's wing, and
2) decoying the enemy's forces
deep into his own rear area, with
the aim of cutting them off from
the defense of their king.


It's a most diverting specta-
cle to watch White's pieces in
their frontal assault on the king,
burrowing further and further,
while Black is transferring his
forces by roundabout routes.

A small but significant opening
subtlety: Black substituted .. bé
and .. Bb7 for the more usual

. Nc6 and .. 0-0; and White, who
failed to notice in time to react
correctly with 7 Ne2, must now
spend an extra tempo preparing
e3-e4. Such details should never
be underestimated, but neither
should they be overvalued. Occa-
sionally it is said that White's
advantage consists of his right
to the first move: should he lose
a tempo, then, the advantage must
necessarily pass to Black. Prac-
tically speaking, however, the ad-~
vantage of playing White boils
down to greater freedom in selec-
ting a plan to suit one's tastes;
once the game has settled into
its ordained track, the loss of
a single tempo is not always so
serious.

Black retreats his knight to
forestall the pin with 12 Bg5, and
to be able to answer f£3-f4 with
.. £7-£5, blockading the king's
wing. White therefore secures f5
before advancing his f-pawn. It
would be senseless to defend the
pawn at c4 now: that pawn was
doomed by White's fifth move.

White's attack has become ra-
ther threatening. Black's pre-
vious move was necessary to fore-
stall White's intention to push
his pawn to f6, and then, after
16.. N:£6, to pin the knight af-
ter all, piling up on the king
with the combined firepower of
queen, rooks and three minor
pieces. Even now, White needs
only two moves to transfer his
rook and queen to the h-file, and
then it might appear that nothing
could save the black king.


Euwe, however, is not easily
flustered. Remember that in his
lifetime he played more than
seventy games with Alekhine, the
most feared attacking player of


[17]


our time.

16. Sieve b6-b5!


The beginning of a remarkable
plan. Clearly, any defensive ma-
neuvers on the kingside are fore-
doomed, since they involve pieces
with an inconsequential radius of
activity (.. Rf7, .. Qe7, etc.)
But Black does have another de-
fensive resource, and that is
counterattack! The bishop at b/7,
the rook at c8, and the knight at
c4 are all well-based; all that
remains is to bring up the queen.
The basis for this counterattack
is Black's preponderance on the
central squares. With 16..b5,
Black reinforces the knight onc4
and opens a path for the queen
to b6é. Still, one cannot help
feeling that his operations are
too little and too late ...

17. Rf4-h4 Qd8-b6

Pinning White's queen to. the
defense of the d-pawn, Black
prevents the intended 18 Qh5.
After 17 Qh5 Qb6 18 Ne2 Ne5, we
get the echo-variation, with the
white rook unable to get to h4.

Thus, White has broken through
after all, at an insignificant
cost. Once again, Black's posi-

If Black's 16th move was the

sacrifice is its fundamental tac-

drawing the white queen still
further afield and decoying it
away from the c2 square, mean-
while attacking the king.

Be1-b2 ae
Trying to improve one's posi-

tion, and finding the correct


[19]


idea to accomplish that end, is
one of the bases of chess strat-
egy in every phase of the game.
The proper move order also plays
an important part, but this falls
under the heading of tactical im-
plementation, which of course is
a major determinant of the even-
tual success of the strategic
plan.


Here, White's basic idea is
obvious: he needs a good devel-
opment for both his bishops. He
can accomplish this in two ways:
either by playing a4 followed by
Ba3, or by taking de be, and then
playing c4. Apparently against
all logic, however, White places
his bishop on a diagonal whichis
occupied by pawns, seemingly in-
viting Black to play ..c4 him-
self, and shut the bishop in for
good.


Why? As it turns out, 11 a4
would have been met by 11.. cd
12 cd Bg4, or 12 ed Ne4, attack-
ing the c-pawn; and 11 de be
12 c4 would allow the reply
12.. Rb8, preventing 13 Bb2.


Having played 11 Bb2, however,
White can go ahead with his c3-c4,
either at once or after the pre-
liminary 12 de be; so Black's re-
ply is not merely useful, but al-
most obligatory. The next phase
of the struggle is defined by the
new pawn structure: already it
has much less to do with the
tastes and preferences of the
two players than it has to do
with their choice of opening.
White will set his f- and e-
pawns in motion, creating a
passed d-pawn and combining the
advance of these central pawns
with an attack on the f-file.
Black, with three pawns to two
on his right wing, cannot do too
much with them for the moment,
since he must first battle the
white bishop pair and central
preponderance.

Black could have altered the
course of the struggle here by
taking the knight: 13.. B:f3
14. gf Nh5; but he refrained
from doing so. The standard ex-
planation — White would be left
with the two bishops, a strong


pawn center, and the open g-
file — could hardly have de-
terred him, since one bishop
would be blocked by its own
pawns, and the pawn center is
not dangerous for the moment.
If 15 e4, for example, then
15.. Nf4 16 Kh1 Qh4 17 Bel Nd3
18 B:d3 cd 19 Qe3 de 20 fe Rfe8
21 £3 £5 22 e5 Rad8, and the
pawn at d3 is taboo.


However, after 13..B:f3 14 gf
Nh5 White could systematically
strengthen his position with
£4, £3, Qf2, Rael, Bcl, Khi1 and
e4, in that or in some other or-
der, depending on how Black re-
plies (Rg1 might also prove ne-
cessary, etc.). A direct attack
on the king would be Black's
only possible counter, and it
would have had very small chances
of success, considering his re-
stricted maneuvering space: the
pawn barriers hamper the mobility
of his knights.


Petrosian continues following
his own line, figuring that as
long as he has made no unsound
moves, nor upset the positional
balance, he will not risk finding
himself in a losing position.

Reshevsky's clever play com-
bined with Petrosian's iron log-
ic make this game one of the
tournament's jewels. Black must
stop White's pawns, so Petrosian
gives up the exchange at a spot
of his own choosing, freeing e7
for the transfer of his knight to
d5. Of course, Black gets good
compensation for the exchange:
his knight is much stronger on
d5, as is his bishop, which no
longer has an opponent. Note
that here, or even on the pre-
vious move, White might have
launched a direct attack with
h4 followed by h5 and Rg3, with
good winning chances; but he ex-
pects to win a different way.

Black, naturally, had no choice,
since taking the a-pawn would have
been senseless. But now it is
White who must solve a difficult
psychological problem: should he
exchange on b4, which practically
guarantees the draw, or advance
the pawn, driving out the knight
and obtaining winning chances, as
well as losing ones?


With no time left in which to
calculate variations, it is un-
derstandable that Reshevsky chose
the simpler continuation. After

Black quickly counbet ab iee ke’ the

This costs a lot of time, how-


ever,


and the result obtained is


disproportionately small, com-
pared with the amount of effort
expended. The knight occupies a
passive position on c/, where it
remains unemployed for some time.
In the end, it nearly costs Black

The positions of Black's pieces
give the e- and f-pawns an insen-

acquiring more and more territo-

additionally, his last move
helped fix the black e- and f-
pawns on dark squares.


Still, White might have given
some thought to the transfer of
his bishop to a different diag-

work here by inducing ..f6, and
might have caused Black consid-
erable grief after 23 Bel. 23 Ral

Why did White sacrifice that
pawn? Can't Black begin a coun-
terattack now? Not yet; and,
meanwhile, White needs only two
or three moves — Nc3 and Rb1,
for example — to take over all
the key points on the queenside,
and then to pick up the c5- or
the e7-pawn. The knight's poor
placement at a8 helps White
greatly in the execution of this
plan.

White's last two moves weren't
bad, but they could have been a
little better: for instance,

27 BF2 Rc8 28 Qd3 Kg7 29 h4. Now
Najdorf finds a way to introduce

tactical complications, and, more
importantly, to exchange queens,

which eases his defense.

White overestimated the strength
of the pawn at d3 in rejecting this
continuation, although his pawn on
d5 would have been much more dan-
gerous.


The best line of all would have
been 33 Bg3, instead of 33 Kf3,

quite playable. Although Black

Gligoric is not afraid of the
further advance of Black's pawns,
correctly judging that this will
only weaken Black's position. So
he invites 12..h5, and where is
the player who could resist such
temptation? Taimanov saw just in
time, however, that after 12..h5?
13 h4!, it is not Black who has
the attack, at any rate. So he
increases the pressure on e4 by
means of the quiet maneuver Nb8-
d7-f6, which results in a slight
advantage for Black.


However, White might have cast
doubt on Black's whole system of
development if he had played
something more concrete than his
clever castling idea: that being
12 d5, cutting communications be-


tween the bishop at b7 and the
knight at e4. After 12.. ed,
White would play 13 Nd4 (which
would also meet most of Black's
other replies), with a very po-
werful attack: he threatens, am-
ong other things, simply 14 f3.


Though I know I'm anticipating,
I still can't resist mentioning
that less than two years after
this game, in the 22nd USSR Cham-
pionship, Taimanov reached pre-
cisely this position against Ke-
res, for which the Estonian had
prepared (as he himself tells us)
the improvement 12 d5! Keres’
idea and the author's thus coin-


cided =<- and immediately diverged:


White answered 12..ed, not with

Taimanov has kept his pawn oc-
tave whole, while White's is
slightly marred in two places ——
which more or less defines the
extent of Black's positional ad-
vantage. All the minor pieces
having been traded off in the
preceding phase of the game, now
the pawns' turn comes: twelve of


them will disappear in the next
twelve moves! This statistic is
also a reflection of the essen-
tial point of White's strategy:
to denude the black king and
also to give Black some queen-
side pawn weaknesses with the
break c4-c5.

The Catalan only appears to be
a harmless opening: in reality,
it conceals a number of subtle-
ties, which is why it is so of-
ten played by such as Keres,
Smyslov and Petrosian. White's
move, 5 Nf3, is one such nuance.
Usually, check is given here, and
the pawn recaptured, but this al-
lows Black to develop his bishop


via d7 to c6. Now, however,
White has the choice, depending
upon circumstances, of recover-
ing his pawn by Nf3-e5:c4 or
Nbi-d2:c4, or going back to Qdi-
a4:c4,

If Black plays it like a
Queen's Gambit, and tries to
"equalize" by means of the stan-
dard maneuver ..c7-c5, the fian-
chettoed bishop unleashes tre-
mendous power: for example, 5..c5
6 0-0 Nc6 7 Qa4 Bd7 8 de Nad
9 Qc2 B:c5 10 Ne5 Rc8 11 Nc3 bd
12 Bg5, and White has an out-
standing game.

A new line. Black wants to
draw the bishop out to d2 to
prevent the knight from using
that square. On 6 Nbd2 White

when Black retains his pawn; but
it would be interesting to see
what would happen after 8 Ba3

moving Black's lightsquare bi-
shop and thereby strengthening
his own.

both sides repeat moves...

Black counterattacked White's

prevent White's d4-d5, but his
plan failed: the rook had to go
back in order to defend the f-
pawn, and White advanced his d-
pawn. The position also admits
of a different, and sharper, han-
dling: 14 Bd3 would maintain the
tension at c5 and e5, force a
weakening of Black's king's wing,
and prepare an attack with his
pieces: for example, 14..h6

White threatens to play f2-f4,

would open up the game in White's

view of Bb1, when the white
queen will invade at h7. So
Black begins the construction of
a defensive perimeter based on
his pawn at e5. 17..Bd7 is nec-
essary to meet the threat of

to storm the king's position;
and in the event of an endgame,
he is ready with his protected
passed pawn at d5. On the nega-
tive side, of course, there is
that bishop at a2, but that can
always be redeployed via bl to
d3. How is Black to meet the im-
pending attack on his king? He
must ready himself to weather the
storm by placing his pawns on
dark squares, his rooks on the
e-file, and his knight at d6,
where it blockades the pawn and
covers the light squares.

Correctly evaluating the posi-

on e5, even though he would hold
a clear advantage after 25 fe fe
26 R£1, followed by the doubling
of the rooks on the f-file, since
one of the black rooks would have
to remain tied to the defense of
the e-pawn. The reason he didn't
take the pawn is that Black would
have answered 25 fe with 25..R:e5,
and the black knight which would
soon enter d6 would be not a bit
weaker than a white rook. Now,
with Black's bishop immured, White
can bring up his rooks and push
his g- and h-pawns.

had a very difficult time of it.
White's next move, however, slows
the pace of the attack, allowing
Reshevsky to slip in a little re-

(his extra pawn on the queenside,
the possible attack on the pawn

Practically speaking, the short-
est game of the tournament: even
though it did continue until the
4ist move, after this check Sza-
bo might as well have resigned,
since in effect he is now giving
Keres odds of pawn and move (odds
once given by masters to first-
category players in the handicap
tourneys of Chigorin's day). One
wonders how, after prolonged con-
sideration, Szabo could blunder
a pawn as early as move five. Ke-
res was more than a little amazed
himself: he spent fifteen min-
utes considering his reply.

The whole problem is that White
has not yet played e2-e3. With
the bishop's diagonal open,..b/7-
b5 would require extensive anal-
ysis, since White could then sim-
ply take the pawn with his knight
and meet ..Bd7 with B:c4. But now
his choice is either to remain a
pawn down, or to give up a piece:
6 N:b5 Bd7 7 N:c7+ Q:c7 8 Qc2,
hoping to pick up the c-pawn as
well eventually. Even in that


highly problematical event, how-
ever, he would still have only
two pawns for his piece.

A pawn down, Szabo panics: why
not 8 Be3, when his two center
pawns, e4 and d4, promise White
plenty of opportunities to com-
plicate? Szabo's 8 Bg5 gives up
a second pawn, in hopes that if
it is taken he will gain several
tempi to complete his develop-
ment. However, Keres easily re-
pels the attack, remaining two
pawns up.

Smyslov makes frequent use of
this line of the Grunfeld, where
Black attacks the center pawns
with ..c5 and ..e6, trades off
on 45 and blockades the pawn by
planting his knight at do. Iso-
lated and blockaded though it
may be, the white d-pawn remains
very strong nevertheless. Black
must always be prepared for its
advance, especially considering
how difficult it will be for him
to actually get either one of his
knights from b6 or b8 to dé. The
outcome of this game will depend
on whether White finds an appro-
priate moment to advance the pawn
to d6 and secure it there. If he
can, then he will have the advan-
tage; if not, Black will obtain
good counterchances.


In my personal opinion, the
system looks good for White. It
is possible that Smyslov now
shares this opinion, since, de-
spite the successful outcome of
this game, he did not employ the
system again, either at Zurich or
at any other tournament thereaf-
ter.

Smyslov is dealing with a great
expert on the Grunfeld. At the
Amsterdam 1950 tournament, Euwe
played a similar game against
Pilnik, continuing here with
10 Nbc3. In the tournament book
Euwe noted that the move was not
good, and recommended the con-
tinuation 10 a4! Na6 11 Na3 ed
12 ed Nb4 13 Nc3! Smyslov goes
into the line nonetheless, which
gives this game added interest.


Curiously enough, in Game 129
(Round 19) against Keres, Euwe
played 10 Nec3, and in his notes
calls this move stronger than
10 a4.


Both moves seem adequate to me.

13. ets Na6-b4
14. Bci-e3 Ra8-c8


Smyslov plays an active de-
fense: now he threatens to occu-
py 43 with a piece, severing the
enemy communications between
flanks. Advancing his pawn to d6,
with the exchange sacrifice that
follows, appears to be the logi-
cal end of White's entire setup,
but it would have had more effect
after 15 a5,


15, _d5-d6 B£5-d3

The strategic idea is correct,
but its tactical formulation is
wrong. Now 16 a5 was necessary in
order to meet 16.. B:f1 17 K:f1
Nd7 18 B:b7 Rb8 with 19 a6. After
the text, an interesting battle
of the pieces ensues, where cal-
culation reigns supreme, and
where Black's chances are objec-
tively no worse.

Two pawns, one of them passed

change; the maneuver Smyslov be-
gins with this move, however, un-
derscores the weakness of the
pawn at dé. 22 Nb5 is now impos-

the bishop has to retreat.

Smyslov's determination to play

move 28 Qd6, whose main continu-
ation runs: 28.. Rb6 29 Qe7 Nc6
30 Q£6+ Kg8 31 Rd1, which threat-
ens the killing 32 Bd5+. Black

With the queen on d6, White

traded queens, recovered the ex-

29. Kfi-gl Qa5=c5

reenters the fray elegantly and

the pinned knight.

Now Black is a piece up, and
the win is, as they say, a mat-
ter of technique. In the present
instance, however, the technique
will be anything but simple; for
the piece White has, besides two
pawns, some other chances as
well: his king is better shel-
tered, and Black's knight has
no support points in the center.


In general, Black's plan will
be to avoid exchanging queenside
pawns, to find shelter for his
king, to bring his knight to the
kingside, and finally, to attack
the white pawns at f2 and b2 (or
b3) with overwhelming force.


The fulfilment of this plan
requires exceptional restraint,
deep calculation, and rapid as-
sessment of the positions that
occur along the way.

An unusual and somewhat passive
system Stahlberg employs occas-
ionally against the King's In-
dian. The e-pawn is kept at home,
and the c-pawn advanced but one
square; the d-pawn is traded off,
as White refrains absolutely from
either creating a pawn center or
participating in the fight for
the central squares. Not infre-
quently this results in a great
deal of maneuvering, followed by
exchanges, and a draw; but for
this game, Geller will have none
of it. Instead, he wages a very
active campaign for more terri-

then over the entire board.

Stahlberg's maneuverings are
not dictated by any strategic
plan, but rather by practical
guidelines he has derived from
his enormous tournament exper-
ience and chess-sense: advance
no pawns, create no glaring weak-
nesses, show not the slightest
aggressive intent; but meanwhile,
do not avoid exchanges, and be
ready to set a tactical snare at
any moment. So now, despite a
whole series of planless (but al-
so harmless) moves, White's po-
sition is not yet bad, on the
whole. Geller shows great re-
sourcefulness and determination
in breaking down Sree lar e

toothless — defense.

Black's advantage has crystal-

the powerful chain of Black's
kingside pawns is always ready
to be set in motion. All of this
put together, however, is not yet
enough to win with. Black under-
takes a queenside pawn advance as
well, in order to restrict still
further his opponent's pieces;

then he trades off all White's

Geller's last move before the

can reply .. b5-b4 with tempo.


Black's central exchange aims
at securing an unhampered devel-
opment for his pieces, followed
by the establishment of a piece
on d5. This relieves White of his
main headache in the Queen's Gam-
bit Accepted, namely: the devel-
opment of his queen's bishop; it
also opens up the e-file.


Boleslavsky amasses a great
pile of pieces in the center, and
then sets off some interesting
complications, with the d-pawn
acting as a fuse.

a win for White, some thirty
moves hence. Stahlberg, and Euwe
as well in his earlier commenta-
ries, suggest that 13.. Nb4 was
the required response here. How-
ever, Rauzer showed in some ra-
ther old analysis that the con-~
tinuation 13.. Nb4 14 d5 Nb:d5
15 N:d5 B:d5 16 B:d5 N:d5 17 Bie?
Q:e7 18 R:d5 favors White. Naj-
dorf therefore recommended 13..Nd5
14 N:d5 B:g5 15 Nc3 Nb4, a view
later adopted by Euwe also.


We should like to go a little
more deeply into the concept of


"mistake", as it is applied to
chess. To begin with, the mis-
takenness of 13.. Na5 was only
demonstrated as a result of
White's clever and by no means
obvious continuation. His advan-
tage finally boiled down to his
possession of a strong bishop
against Black's knight in an
endgame: certainly not all that
simple, nor all that much!


Secondly, it's not clear how
the battle might have gone after
13.. Nd5, since White had the
secret weapon 14 N:d5 B:g5 15 Nb6.
If Black plays 15.. Rb8, instead
of taking the knight, he loses
the exchange after 16 N:g5 and
17 Nd7; and on 15.. Ra7 16 d5 is
very strong. If he takes the
knight on b6, however, Blackwill
be in a real predicament after
16 N:g5: 16.. h6 loses to the
sacrifice at f7 followed by
18 Q:e6, and there seems to be
no clear defense to the thematic
push d4-d5, since 16.. N:d4 fails
against 17 Qd3 Nf5 18 N:e6 fe
19 B:e6+ Kh8 20 B:£5, or 18..Qc6
19 Nf4, etc.


Had the game in fact taken such
a course, then 13.. Nd5 would have
been labeled the mistake, and
13.. Na5 recommended instead, since
it does not appear to be too dan-
gerous.


Black's difficulties appear to
have another cause entirely. Com-
pared with Black's pieces, White's
have made three extra moves! —
both rooks to central files, and
the bishop to an attacking diag-
onal. If there is logic in chess,
then those three powerful devel-
oping moves must tell somehow. It
is a grandmaster's task to dem-
onstrate White's advantage, and
in this case the proof was of the
complicated combinative sort.


Such melding of logic and com-
binative powers is the hallmark
of Boleslavsky.

It is easy to see that taking
the d-pawn with bishop, knight or
pawn would cost a piece.

If the bishop takes the knight
at £3, there follows 16 ef+ Kh8
17 R:d8 B:e2 18 R:a8 R:a819 R:e2
and Black has two pieces en prise;
when one falls, White wilT be two
pawns ahead. If that's not enough
for White, he can also play

Credit is due White also for
selecting precisely this out of
all the possible continuations
here. The phrase which comes to
mind is: "Black's two bishops
and good development in an open
position fully compensate his
pawn minus." But now, it turns
out, the two bishops will dis-
appear, and the bad knight re-
main, compensating nothing —
but all this had to be foreseen!

Now Boleslavsky must demonstrate
his endgame skill. White begins
with a typical technique in such
bishop/knight endings: placing his
bishop three squares distant from
the enemy knight on an opposite-
colored square, thereby totally
depriving the knight of moves.


[35]


Getting out via £6 would be abso-
lutely hopeless, since the knight/
bishop ending with an extra pawn
is a dead win for White.


Boleslavsky continues by fix-
ing the a- and b-pawns on light
squares and bringing up his king;
then, after a few more prepara-
tory moves, he can pick off the
a-pawn with his knight.

Other things being equal, it's

In many variations of the Nim-
zo-Indian, an exchange on c3
leaves White with the two bishops.
In this case, it is Black who has
the two bishops, but White has
the better position. He has a
lead in development, with pros-
pects of capitalizing on it,
since Black has a backward pawn
at d7 and the weak square d6.
Geller occupies d6 with his
knight, and then uses his rook
to fix the weak pawn at d7. Bo-
leslavsky's counterplay is based
on his strong bishop, which will
sweep a long diagonal after
White's coming e4-e5, and on the
possibility of opening the g-
file for his major pieces.

This queenside diversion (b2-
b4, followed by a2-a4 and b4-b5)
would have been a good idea un-
der more peaceful circumstances
—with the queens gone, for ex-
ample. This was a good time to
think of defense with 24 Qe3 or
24 Kgi; but Geller, more from
inertia than for any other rea-
son, continues to press, hoping
to force a win from a position
not yet ripe for it. Now Bole-


slavsky lays his trumps on the
table.

First comes this attack on the
Pawn at £4, exploiting the
back-rank mate threat: if 25 b5,
for example, then Black takes
twice.
25. Rd6-d4 g7-g5
Another pair of trumps: the g-
file is opened, and Black also
demonstrates that the rook at d4
is no defender of the pawn at f4.


26. Khi-gi


The sudden turn of events has
affected Geller's nerve and self-
possession. There was no need to
give the pawn away: 26 Qe3 was
still playable. Even though White
has to submit to a powerful at-
tack — 26 Qe3 gf 27 R:f£4 Qg5

For this game, the chessboard
becomes a battleground of prin-
ciple between Smyslov and Stahl-
berg, who are repeating their
game from the Budapest 1950 tour~
nament. There, Stahlberg contin-
ued with 11.. Ba4, only to dis-
cover, after 12 N:f6+, that he
could not recapture with his
queen because of 13 B:a4 and
14 Qc4, winning a pawn. So here,
he delays the exchange of light-
square bishops for two moves, but
without achieving any substantial
improvement.


White has a palpable advantage
in space and complete freedom of
maneuver, while Black's bisho
remains under attack by White s
knight and requires the queen's
protection; the black knight's
movements are quite restricted
too. Under these circumstances,
the slightest misstep could be
fatal for Black.

White threatened 18 N:f6+,
forcing the pawn recapture,
since on 18.. Q:f6 19 c5 would
win the b-pawn. 1i7.. Qc7 does
not meet this threat, however.


But it is hard to criticize
Stahlberg for not playing the
more accurate 17.. Rd7, since in
this case akso White would have
many ways to strengthen his po-~
sition, such as 18 a4, or 18 Nc5
and 19 Nd3, to say nothing of the
simple 18 N:f6+, followed by

Ne5 and Rel-e3-h3 for an attack.

Smyslov's logical play has been
making Black's defense more and
more difficult. He cannot take
the c-pawn, of course, because of
20 Qh6, which leaves him no time
to defend the f6-pawn: for exam-
ple, 19.. N:c4 20 Qh6 Qe7 21 Nh4,
threatening 22 Nf£5 and 22 Rd3.
Nor does 19.. Kh8 save him, in
view of 20 Qh6 Nd7 21 d5, and
the exchange of pawns brings
White's rook to d5 and thence
to h5; or 20.. Qe7 21 Nh4. After
the text, White must bring his
knight to g4 in order to contin-
ue his attack — but how?


20.


Nf£3-e5 eiaese








A beautiful move, captivating
in its simplicity: since the only
route to g4 lies through e5, the
knight runs full tilt onto the
bayonets — what could be sim-
pler! The point is, of course,
that taking the knight would
open the door for White's queen
and rook to set up a mating at-~
tack: 20.. fe 21 Qg5+, followed
by 22 Qf6+ and 23 Re3.


[38]


(In this line we find a pretty
forcing maneuver to keep the king
in the corner which you may find
useful: 21 Qg5+ Kh8 22 Qf6+ Kg8
23 Re3 Rfe8 24 Qh6 — a quiet
move — 24.. Kh8 25 Rg3, threat-
ening Qg7 mate, and on 25.. Rg8,
obviously, there follows 26 Qf6+,


20. sas Qc7-e7
21. Ne5-g4 R£8-¢8
22. Ngd-h6 es


A small concluding combination:
the rook cannot escape, due to
the threat of 23 Nf5+. In addi-
tion to the text, whereby White
wins the exchange, and thus ren-
ders the remainder of the game a
matter of technique, there was
also 22 Qh6+, a reasonable move
which maintains the attack.

You will find this diagram in
the book "Grunfelda Odbrana" by
Trifunovic, Gruber and Bozic
(Section One, System Two, Variant
# 18, Continuation A), with anote
stating that Black, for his two
sacrificed pawns, has two threats:

sides are playing a prepared line;

uses one bishop to meet both
threats.

recovers one of his pawns; and
if 17 Qd4 Qh5, when Black's threat

tling and allows the recovery
of one of Black's pawns.

White violates one of the clas-
sic principles of the opening by
thus moving the same piece twice;
as a matter of fact, he is pre-
paring to move the knight yet a
third time, in order to bring it
to c4. Is this the end of the
principle, then? Of course not!
Black, you see, has already vio-
lated classical principles twice
himself, by exchanging a center
pawn for a wing pawn and by giv-
ing himself a backward pawn at
d6; with his last move, further-
more, he has saddled himself with
weaknesses on the dark squares as
well. If one side were to play
concretely, however, while the
other side contented himself with
following the rules, the winner
would not be difficult to predict..


(Let's take an extreme case:

1 £2-£3? e7-e6 2 g2-g4? What
should Black do? Moving the queen
so early in the game is not gen-
erally recommended, but in this
instance, taking White's errors
into consideration, 2.. Qd8-h4
does not look bad.)


The knight maneuver from £3 via
d2 to c4 in this position was
played by Nimzovich in a famous
game against Marshall from the
New York 1927 tournament; since
then, it has become popular. Its
point is to generate enough pres-
sure on the d-pawn and the square
b6 to prevent Black from carrying
out his only possible active plan
here: .. a7-a6, .. b/-b5, etc.,
which, with the knight on c4, can
be met with a2-a4-a5. Additionally,
from d2 the knight can support the
advance e2-e4: combined with f£2-f4
and e4-e5, this is White's main
strategic idea in this position.

White has the better position.
Black has no immediate prospects
of exploiting his "extra" queen-
side pawn, since the pawn at a5
restrains two of Black's pawns.
Meanwhile, White can begin the
pawn roller with e4, £4 and e5
at the first available opportun-
ity, clearing the way for the
d-pawn. Gligoric, however, pre-
fers piece maneuvers to all-out
pawn assaults, so the e-pawn
never even gets as far as the
fourth rank.

White still has the advantage.
He intends to smoke the knight
out of e5 and weaken Black's
king position by the exchange of
bishops, and then play e2-e4-e5.
Sensing real danger, Petrosian
tries some tactics; his next two
moves, ..c5-c4 and ..f7-f£5, com-
plicate his position, but do not
improve it.

28. Taimanov—Najdort
(King’s Indian)

Let the reader be forewarned:
this was one of the tourney's
most interesting games, and the
recipient of a brilliancy prize.
Both of its phases — opening
and middlegame — were conducted
by Najdorf with such a high de-
gree of erudition and mastery
that the need of a third phase
never arose.

6. Bft-e2 e7-e5
Te 0-0 Nb8-c6
8. d4-d5 sae


Not too long before this tour-
nament, Taimanov employed this
opening variation — 7.. Nc6
8 d5 — twice in the 20th USSR
Championship. In both cases, he


scored with one and the same
plan: a pawn break on the c-
file, followed by an outflanking
and turning maneuver around the
entire grouping of Black's pie-
ces on the d- through g-files,
leaving only the darksquare bi-
shop to guard his king. These
games made the rounds of the
chess press, and the general
consensus was that they had been
lost in the opening.


However, a few players still
ventured this "refuted" varia-
tion of the King's Indian; at
the Mar del Plata tournament of
1953, for example, Najdorf fell
victim to fashion: playing White,
in this variation, he lost to
Gligoric and only drew with dif-
ficulty against Trifunovic. At
the start of the tournament in
Zurich, however, these games were
not known to Taimanov.


Thus, both sides played the
opening with great expectations:
Najdorf, having absorbed the Yu-
goslav analyses, which ran at
least to move 21, and Taimanov,
still flushed with his previous
successes.

12. Be3-f2 seats


Taimanov's kingside defensive
array appears most imposing: the
pawns on light squares form akind
of toothed fortress wall, withthe
darksquare bishop covering the
gaps between the teeth. But if
the position be examined without
prejudgment, then it would be
naive to speak of any sort of ad-
vantage to White. Could Black
hope to obtain more from the op-
ening than the development of all
his pieces, the advance .. f£7-f5-
£4, occupation of the dark squares,
and substantial attacking pros-
pects on the kingside? Naturally,
in view of the extreme sharpness
of the position, Black must play
exactly, combining his attack with
defense of the queen's wing, espe-
cially d6 and c7 — and seize ev-
ery tactical chance.

This was the system employed
by Gligoric and Trifunovic at
Mar del Plata. Now the d-pawn is
defended, the rook can go to the
g-file, and Black's knights hov-
er over the king's wing. Taiman-
ov, however, trusts the invulner-
ability of his position, and con-
tinues with his cavalier assault
on the queenside.

tions, Taimanov changes key, and
invites his opponent to trip the
light combinative. Psychologic-
ally correct, this decision is
also very much in accord with
Taimanov's style.

and so he contents himself with
the trade of rook and two pawns
for both the knights. Material
equality is maintained, and the
struggle flares anew.

A position which occurs so of-
ten these days that it might be
worthwhile to say a few words
about it here: not about systems,
or variations to boggle the mem-
ory, but about the ideas which
will direct the play on both
sides for many moves to come.


By this exchange in the cen-
ter, Black has opened his bish-
op's diagonal to attack the d4
square; shortly, he will also
attack the pawn at e4 with rook
and knight. The knight's position


on c5 will be secured with .. a5,
and this pawn may also be pushed
further: to a4, and even to a3.


For the moment, White attacks
nothing, but he does dispose of
a strong center and freedom to
maneuver. Look at the board:
White's pieces and pawns occupy
four ranks, and Black's, three,
with a "no-man's-land" between.
These geometrical features large-
ly reflect the character of the
opening, as the opposing forces
have not yet come into contact.
White's further plans are simple:
to develop the bishop and the
queen, to connect his rooks, pre-
pare an attack on the weak pawn
at d6 with which Black must even-
tually saddle himself in this de-
ployment, and keep an eye on the
defense of the e-pawn. The dif-
fering ways to defend this pawn
lead to different systems of play.
Qc2 would be a handy move, but
this would leave the knight on
d4 en prise for a moment, which
Black might be able to exploit;
if Be3 is played first, then
Black has .. Ng4. It is this sort
of tempo-play, with its many com-
binative possibilities (due to
the fact that all of the pieces
and nearly all of the pawns are
still on the board), that makes
the King's Indian Defense such
a delight to its adherents.


9. aes Nd7-c5
10. £2-£3 eee

Before leaving for this tourna-
ment, every one of its partici-
pants prepared a few new systems,
especially in the popular openings
such as the King's Indian, the Si-
cilian and the Nimzo-Indian. One
of the best of these must be the
system Averbakh introduced in the
present game: £3, and Rf2-d2.
White prepares an attack on the
d-pawn, but practice has shown
that it makes little sense to take
it with the queen, since on d6
the queen itself becomes vulner-
able to attack, and must quickly
retreat. The enemy camp must there-
fore be invaded with a weaker
piece first. The move 10 £3 also
secures the pawn at e4, while the
fianchettoed bishop's diagonal
is only closed temporarily.

White's position is solid as a

since 14.. Rd8 obviously loses to

the challenge: his is not amech-
anical but a creative mastery of
every nuance of the King's Indian.
It's hard to believe that ten
moves hence Black still will not
have had to give up his d-pawn!

One of those dynamic positions
characteristic of contemporary
chess, in which one may evaluate


the possibilities for both sides,
but find it difficult to deter-
mine which side has the advan-
tage. Usually, both sides feel
they stand better; occasionally,
both sides think that they stand
worse. In the present instance,
the pivotal factor is the pawn at
e5. With the support of rook and
queen, it may easily advance to
e3. To counteract this, White
tries to disorganize the enemy
ranks by carrying out flanking
raids with his cavalry. Black
decides not to waste time re-
treating the bishop, since the
exchange on c5 would develop his
knight to a good position and un-
cover his queen's bishop as well.
Black's move also cuts off the
retreat at £3 from the white
king's knight. All of these ad-
vantages are more than enough
compensation for the "sacrifice"
of his Indian bishop.

With the unsubtle threat of

in spiriting his bishop away,
not only giving his queen the
square a5, but also underscoring
the misplaced state of the knight
at a4. After 13 Nic5 N:c5 14 Ne3
the game would have been roughly
even, while now Black has the
initiative firmly in hand. Un-
willing to settle for a titmouse,
Szabo goes after an entire crane—
and sure enough, soon one flies

18. see Qh5:e2


With this, Black's queen sets
out on a long and hazardous jour-
ney. Five queen moves for a sin-
gle pawn: even the arithmetical
balance is clearly unfavorable
to Black. Still, what can White
accomplish with those five moves?


19. Ral-d1 Qe2-d3
20. Qe2-cl Qd3-d6
21. g3-g4 Qd6-c7


So, White has made just one
useful move: 19 Rd1; and as for
those kingside pawn moves, those
might better be called double-
edged than favorable to White.


To which we might add that
Black could have made still bet-
ter use of his pieces, with
19.. Nc5 20 Nc3, and now 20.. Qd3.
In that event Black's knight
would stand actively on c), the
queen's bishop would have been
uncovered, and White's bishop
would have been temporarily de-
prived of the c3 square.


What conclusion may we draw
from all of this? That when one
is well developed, one can afford
to spend a few moves to capture
an important enemy pawn; but bear
in mind that one must also eval-
uate the position correctly, and
calculate accurately...

Black breaks both of the rules


laid down in the previous note,
in his distracted determination
to exploit the position of the
white knight on a4. The obvious
22.. b5 would have forced White
to trade off his best piece, the
bishop on c3. But 23 B:f6 N:f6

White is master of the diagonal
al-h8. Knowing Szabo's skill with
a direct attack, I had no illu-

fights on with the energy of
despair.

A bit of tactics: White draws
the knight to e5 in order to set
up the following fork. Strangely
enough, however, this move gives
Black defensive chances, since
the diagonal al-h8 is briefly

Perhaps an appropriate contin-
uation with a different move-
order — for instance. that which
occurred in Game 9, Geller-Euwe,
where Bd3 had not yet been played
and Black had not yet castled.
There, White had to expend a move
on f£2-£3, whereas here he could
play 8 ed, easily carrying out an
advance that would ordinarily have
cost him a good deal of trouble.
It is amazing that Reshevsky, who
is such an expert on the Black
side of the Samisch line, should
have allowed such a possibility,
and also that Euwe should not have
exploited it. After 8 e4, 9 Bg5


[51]


is threatened, and if Black's
knight retreats to e8, then
9 Qh5! begins White's attack
before castling.


The reader will find just such
a development of events in Game
77, when Reshevsky ventured a re-
peat of this variation against
Keres.

One might assume Reshevsky had
forgotten that pawns may also
move two squares! However, the
gradual advance of this pawn has
its logic too. With White play-
ing slowly (10 Ng3! was best),
Reshevsky amends his error on
move 7, stopping White's e3-e4
for some time to come. After
10 Ng3, 10.. d5 could have been
met by 11 cd ed 12 Nf£5, so the
correct reply would have been
10.. Nc6. But now, Black answers
the exchange of central pawns by
a clever maneuver which is only
possible with the queen at c2.

Black threatens mate at g2,

leaves White only 12 Nf£4, when
the knight will not be very well
placed. Thus, the mate threat
wasn't so naive after all: it
led to a substantive change in
the position which was definite-
ly not in White's favor.

maintaining the option of driv-
ing out Black's queen with ei-
ther Ne5 or Nb4, thus freeing the

33. Stahlberg—Keres
(Queen’s Gambit)

The reader has certainly no-
ticed by this time, and will
probably continue to note, that
we avoid detailed examination of
opening variations. When two ar-
mies march to the battlefield,
there are so many roads they can
take that one could never des-
cribe all of them.


In the present game, however,
we shall make an exception, since
Keres employs a defense that is
not found in the opening books.


1. d2-d4 Ng8-£6


2. c2-c4 e7-e6
3. Ngi-£f3 d7-d5
4. Nbl-c3 e7-c5
Ds c4:d5 c5:d4


Theory examines only 5.. N:d5,
and considers that White gets a
small advantage with the contin-
uation 6 e3 Nc6 7 Bc4. Keres’
move has never been seen in ma-
jor tournaments, and must have
been something Keres whipped up
himself, especially for this
tournament. Is it any good? Ap-
parently, no worse than anything
else; at any rate, Keres used it
three times, and the 2% points
it brought him speak for them-
selves,


6. Qdi:d4


White has gained the time to
develop his queen, but Black wins
it back shortly with 8.. Nc6é.
There would have been no point in
sacrificing a piece for three
pawns by 6 de de 7 ef+ Ke7 8Q:d8+
K:d8 9 be, since the pawn on f7
will fall sooner or later.


6. eee e6:d5
7. Bel-g5 ves


In later games (Nos. 155 and
210), Najdorf and Geller played
7 e4 against Keres, but they
came prepared. In his first en-
counter with an unfamiliar var-
iation, Stahlberg could not risk
a sharp continuation.

then 13.. Qd7, winning a piece.

Keres' new system has success-~

Black has a small but clear
positional advantage, which may
be explained, but is hard to
put into any sort of concrete
form. The black king is better
sheltered from possible checks,
with the pawn at f5 rendering
special service in this regard
by protecting against diagonal
checks. (A similar disadvantage
nearly cost Keres his Round 29
game against Taimanov.) In the


present case, however, the white
pieces are solidly placed, and
the last move, 30.. g6, which
laid bare the seventh rank, cer-
tainly did not increase Black's
winning chances.

It is possible to draw queen
endings with very accurate play.
Keres intends to set up a posi-
tion in which White will not be
able to avoid the exchange of
queens. For this purpose, the
king must be brought to the
queen's wing. The winning method
is interesting, and a useful bit
of knowledge to have, but its
execution in this game was ab-
etted by an inaccuracy from
White.

A defensive system prepared by

though he used it four times,

difficult variation for Black.
Smyslov had to display a great
deal of resourcefulness in order
to equalize, and his opponents
did not always exploit their op-
portunities to the fullest. After
this tournament, neither Smyslov
nor the other masters made much
further use of this defense, so
it has disappeared from practice.

The outcome of a game between
Smyslov and Kotov may be hard to
predict, but there can never be
any doubt about what the opening
will be: Smyslov feels honor-
bound to play 1 e4, and Kotov in-
variably replies 1.. c5.


This time, Kotov alters the
tradition a bit: instead of his
usual Scheveningen, in which
..e5 is played only at the last
minute, with White's threats al-
ready hanging overhead, he tips
his hat to fashion and plays

. e5 on move six. One idea be-
hind this rather eccentric move
is that here 7 Nf£5 is unfavorable,
due ee the reply 7.. B:f£5 and

Smyslov's omission of a2-a4 on

Black too much leeway. Had Black
played 10.. b5, White still might
have replied 11 a4 b4 12 Nd5 N:d5
and retaken with the queen; but
now .. b5 is wholly unobjection-
atle. All that White has gotten
out of the opening is safe and
solid control of e4. That's some-
thing — we shall have numerous
occasions to remember it during
the course of the game — but
still one might have hoped for

Smyslov suggests a transition in-
to an endgame that is slightly
better for him, based on his con-
trol of the square e4,.

Kotov agrees, mistakenly, to
the trade of queens: the weak
pawns at a6 and c4 leave him lit-
tle chance to save the endgame.
With queens still on, Black might
eventually get a chance to play

Smyslov's fine play has brought
the game to this winning position,
but now time-pressure puts him on
the wrong path. 38 fet Ke6 39Rf2

would have been yet more thema-

3. Nbi-c3 e7-e5

A radical means of avoiding
both the Samisch and the Four
Pawns' Attack. Whatever White
plays, the pure Samisch setup is
now unattainable: for example,
after 4 d5, Black is by no means
obliged to fianchetto his bishop,
but may play instead 4.. Bf5,
and if 5 £3 e4.


If 4 e4, Black gains a tempo
for development with 4.. ed 5Q:d4
Nc6, after which he may play ei-
ther 6.. Be7 or 6.. g6. And on
4 de de 5 Q:d8+ K:d8, Black's
king forfeits castling, but will
find shelter at c/7.


However, White still has ways of
exploiting Black's early e-pawn
push, and the one Keres has in
mind is 5 Bg5, a rarely-played
line which is nevertheless one of
White's most solid positional
ideas.


4. Ngl-£3 Nb8-d7
5. Bel-g5 ore


If Black's 2.. d6 and 3.. e5
prevented the strongest of the
anti-King's Indian attacks, then
White, in turn, prevents Black
from obtaining the modern form of
the King's Indian (with a fian-
chettoed king's bishop), since
5.. g6 6 de de 7 Nie5 costs a
pawn. Black, of course, could
play 5.. Be7, but that sort of
development for this bishop grates
on a King's Indian player. In
that case, White would have asim-
ple program: 6 e3, 7 Be2 and 80-0
with no fear of .. e5-e4, since
his queen's bishop is already
outside his pawn chain.


Boleslavsky, who has worked
steadily and with immense suc~
cess at improving the King's In-
dian for Black, feels himself mor-
ally obligated to correct extant
opinions; for this game, he has
prepared a dizzying new line in-
volving the sacrifice of his
queen's rook.

Some pieces in the King's In-
dian appear on a “special price"
list: the darksquare bishops are
at the top of that list. This
means that Black has achieved
something, in removing White's
bishop while retaining his own,
even at the cost of shattering
his own pawns. With his last move,
Black initiates his previously
prepared sharp attacking line,
sacrificing a rook for the attack.


The attack will be based onthe
fact that the centralized knight
is out of play at a8; the whole
question is whether Black can
work up decisive threats in the
short time it will take White to
develop his bishop and get his
knight back to the center.


Boleslavsky had mainly consid-
ered the following line, in which
his darksquare bishop plays the
lead: 10 N:c7+ Kd8 11 N:a8 d5!

12 Rc1 Bb4t+ 13 Nd2 Nc5 14 Re2 Qe5
15 e3 B£5. Najdorf's recommenda-
tion, returning the queen to d8,
is not appealing. His variation:
9.. Qd8 10 Qd4 Ne5 11 N:e5 Bg?
12 N:£7 K:£7 13 Q£4+ Kg8 14 0-0-0
c6 15 Nc3 Qa5, only appears play-
able; in actuality, Black's one
threat, 16.. B:c3, is no threat
at all, and White can cheerfully
take on d6 with his queen, one


possible continuation being:
16 Q:d6 Bic3 17 be Q:c3+ 18 Kb1
BE5+ 19 e4 B:e4+ 20 Bd3.

10. Rai-b1

The simple move which Boleslav-
sky overlooked in his preparatory
analysis. After 10 N:c7+ Kd8, the
move 11 Rb1 would be no problem
for Black, since he would have the
check on c3; here, however, with
the knight on d5, the check is
impossible, and Black' s whole at-
tack is refuted.


10. on Qb2:a2
11.0 Nd5:c7+ Ke8-d8
12. Nc7:a8 Nd7-c5


Blushing furiously at his mis-
take, Boleslavsky commits another.
True, 12.. d5 would have been use-
less now without the check on b4,
but 12.. Bg7 would still have kept
up some semblance of an attack:


for example, 13 Rc1 Qa3 14 Qd2 Nc5.


If Black can pick up the knight on
a8, he will have a pawn for the
exchange. Now, however, Keres can
force the exchange of queens with
a series of precise moves, andall
danger is liquidated.

defense with .. Ne7, avoiding the
pin with Bg5 that would be possi-
ble after .. Nf6. However, 6..c4
gives the d4-pawn great addition-


[59]


al strength: after e2-e4, it will
become passed, and tie down some
black pieces. The black pawn at
c4 cannot be considered its equal
by any stretch of the imagination,
since it is not passed, and is
hardly likely ever to attain that
status.

A Reshevsky novelty: 11 a3 Ba5
12 Qa4 was usual here, but then
comes 12.. Bg4, indirectly at-
tacking, and then capturing, the
d-pawn in return for his c-pawn.
The point of 11 Qc2 is not the
sacrifice of a pawn, of course:
that's so obviously bad for Black
as to render it a mere footnote
(11..N:d4 12 N:d4 Q:d4 13 Rd1 Qe5
14 Bf4, and White recovers the
pawn with a colossal lead in de-
velopment); the idea is that White
can use his attack on the c-pawn
to gain a tempo to bring his rook
to di. With the support of the
rook, that pawn gets very lively
indeed, and runs quickly down to
the seventh rank, setting up dan-
gerous tactical possibilities.

The pawn at d6 is loose, and the

would lose material for Black.

Reshevsky's actual move is al-

39. Bronstein—Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense)


Generally, it makes sense to
sacrifice a pawn, sometimes even
a piece, in order to keep the en-
emy king in the center and assail
it with rooks and queen. However,
two general classes of such at-
tacks must be distinguished: in
the first category, the king is
kept to the eighth rank, hemmed
in by its own pawns and pieces;
while in the second category, the
king is driven out to the sixth
rank — sometimes even to the
fifth — and attempts to find
shelter on one wing or the other.


The present game is an example
of the latter type. The defender's
chief resource is a cool head,
and my opponent made full use of
his here. At one point, I had to
break off my calculations in order
to ask myself: Just who is attack-
ing whom here?


During the game, and afterwards
as well, I was unable to shake
the feeling that somewhere I had
had a win. Perhaps some concrete
variation did flicker momentarily
through my mind, but it tarried
not... In any event, neither I,
nor the commentators (Euwe, Naj-
dorf and Stahlberg) have been
able to find an improvement for
White, which would mean that my
promising piece sacrifice was not
enough for a win. Perhaps the win
may yet be found in analysis; but
even if I did not get the point,
I did get a lively and interesting
game.

This, to me, seems stronger than

tions: 12.. Qe7 13 de N:e5 14N:e5
Q:e5, and 12., Re8 13 de N:e5
14 N:e5 Q:e5 — Black has an ex-

course, Black temporarily pre-
vents 13 e4 with his 12..Qe/7,
but is that move really so dan-

wanted the £5 square kept free
for his bishop; and White is giv-
ing up the piece in order to get

and then assail him with all his
pieces. The battle waxes uncom-

either — an object lesson for


the young player who finds him-

when facing a mating attack), and
chokes up at once, thereby ren-

more difficult.

Since the d-pawn is doomed any-

26 fet Ke6 27 B:c5 R:d2 28 B:e7

even though he is the exchange

Having recovered his piece,
White now attacks the exposed
king; however, he encounters
strategical difficulties in de-
veloping his attack. The king is
surrounded by its own pieces,
which display a sharp tendency
to counterattack at the first
available opportunity. The king
also has many more open squares
about him than would be the case
if White were attacking the cas-
tled position. And finally, with
White's king tucked away at hl,
his own first rank has become
weak.


Nonetheless, White still has
one strong trump: the opposite-
colored bishops, which normally
ensure an advantage to the attack-
ing side. It may have been this
chance that White failed fully to
exploit.

27. Qd2-g5 Ke6-d7

Black would find himself en-
snared after 27.. Qc2 28 Racl,

28 a4, to exploit his strate-

be practically forced to give up
the exchange; he would get a sec-
ond pawn for it, but then the at-
tack of the queen and two rooks
would have become fierce indeed:

To compare this with the 28 a4
line: White has brought his bishop
to the strong diagonal here too,
but he has given up the e-pawn
for nothing. Now he could try
31 R:f5 gf 32 Qg8, but after
32.. Qc6!, this leads to a per-
petual.

31. Qg5-h4 a7-a5

At this point I began to sus-
pect that Black had started to play
for the win. Having determined
that 32 Q:h7 ab 33 Q:f7+ was sim-
ply bad for me, I decided on one
last attacking try: to bring the
bishop via el to g3, creating a
threat to c7.


32. Bb4-el h7-h5
33. Bel-f2 Qb6-a6
34. Bf2-g3 Re5-e4

picture : neither side had more

fall. 35 Qg5 Ke6é looked worse than
unclear, so I decided to stop
tempting fate.

35. Rf1:£5

All of the commentators gave
this move an exclamation mark,
since it was by now White's only
means of forcing a draw. Never-
theless, I feel bound to admit to
the reader that I sacrificed more
from inspiration than from calcu-
lation. 35.. gf 36 Rc7+ Ke8
37 Rc8+ appeared to me to be very
dangerous for Black, for instance:
37.. Kd7 38 Qd8+ Ke6 39 Qe8+ Kf6

Kc6 43 Qh6+ Re6 44 Qcl1t+ Rc5

45 Rc8+ Kd7 46 R:c5. Later it

was shown that not all of Black's
moves in this line were forced,
and that with exact play he could
draw.


Had Euwe taken the rook, there
would have been no practical
reason why he should lose, since
this variation would lie, for the
most part, beyond the time con-
trol; however, he chose the more
natural continuation.

35. Re4:h4

Black's queen had moved to a6,

40. Gligoric—Szabo
(Ruy Lopez)


The prime consideration in
one's choice of an opening plan
should be the harmonious devel-
opment of the pieces, but some-
times we forget about the devel-
opment of the queen. Since the
queen is, after all, the most
important and the most valuable
of the pieces, the success of
the whole piece configuration
may depend on how well the
queen plays its part.


In some openings, the move
-. c is important not only as
a means of attacking the enemy
pawn center, but also in order
to give the queen an exit to
c7, b6 or a5. This applies es-
pecially to systems in which the
bishop is developed to e7, thus
blocking the queen's other dia-
gonal: for example, the Ortho-
dox Queen's Gambit, the Chigo-
rin Ruy Lopez, or the Classical
Variation of the French Defense.


In the game Gligoric - Szabo,
the development of Black's queen
became the central theme of the
opening and middlegame struggle:
White maintained a clear advan-
tage as long as the queen was
relegated to the eighth rank,
and found his game sliding down-
hill as soon as the queen ob-
tained some lebensraum.

Here the Open Defense to the
Ruy branches off into two main

lines: 9.. Be? and 9.. Bc5. To
me, the latter seems more natu-
ral (cf. Game 70, Averbakh -
Szabo), since the bishop is more
actively posted, and the queen
retains the option of developing
on the d8-h4 diagonal.

Black cannot take the pawn be-
cause of the continuation 13 B:c5
B:c5 14 Qe1, winning a piece
(13.. N:£3+ 14 gf Bh3 15 Rel is
no improvement). So he retreats
the knight first. Now the e-
pawn is really threatened; but
Gligoric proceeds to refute
Black's entire opening configu-
ration by means of a pretty and
original queen maneuver, unpinning
his knight and preventing Black
from castling.

Thus, Black has developed all
of his minor pieces well, holds
the advanced e-pawn under obser-
vation, and could now play
14.. Bgé and castle without giv-


ing himself any pawn weaknesses.
But there is one significant
piece weakness in his position,
and that is the queen, which is
not developed, and has no good
prospect of ever doing so —
something which White could have
attempted to exploit with 15 c4.
Whether Black takes or pushes
his pawn, 16 Be4 would be White's
reply; and on 15.. Bg6, White
would have traded bishops and pro-
ceeded with 17 Rd1. Black would
then have faced some difficult
problems, but 16 Be4 would not
have settled the outcome of the
game: 15.. d4 16 Be4 Qd7 would
pose the dilemma for White of
whether to sell his fine game
for a mere pawn. After 17 B:c6
Q:c6 18 N:d4 N:d4 19 B:d4 Bgé6,

I rather prefer Black.


The positional text move does
not cost White his advantage, but
it does slow the game somewhat.

Szabo has spotted the basic
shortcoming of his position,
and decides to postpone castling
until his queen has found a way
to the battlefield (the threat
was 18 Rdi and 19 c4).

19. Bc2:g6 h7:g6
20. Rai-bi Qb8-b5


A chessmaster's skill lies not
so much in perceiving the correct
plan as in carrying it out with
exact and sometimes "only" moves.
In the present case, we have
White proceeding with his stra-
tegically correct play against
the undeveloped queen, but se-
lecting a technically inexact se~
quence: 20 Rfb1 was stronger. In
that event, the a-pawn would have
been defended, and the reply
20.. Qb5, obviously, rendered im-
possible; while Vukovic's recom-
mendation of 20.. Qd8 would be
pointless, since the queen would
be as it was before, with no
field of activity; one possible
line might be 21 Rdi, and if
21.. Qd/, then 22 Nc5 N:c5
23 R:d5, etc., or 21.. Rb8 22 Nbd4
Ne:d4 23 N:d4 Nre5 24 BE4, or
21.. Na/ 22 c4.


21. Qa2-c2


[65]


Gligoric's desire to win this
game exclusively by positional
means, without recourse to any
of the combinative possibili-
ties, leads eventually to his
downfall. 21 Nbd4 might fail to
21.. Q:a5, but 21 Nfd4 was good:
after 21.. Ne:d4 22 N:d4 Q:a5,
White sacrifices his queen —
23 N:c6 Q:a2 24 N:e7+ Kh7 25 Rb4
g5 26 B:g5 g6 27 Rh4t+ Kg7 28 BEG
mate! — a finale that could be
labeled the consistent conclu-
sion to his plan. Of course,

21 Nfd4 would be better met by


21.. Ne:d4 22 cd Qd7 23 Rfcl,
with a minimal edge.

Black's queen needed a long
trek (Qd8-b8-b5-c4-g4-f5) to
achieve the opportunity to ex-
change itself for White's queen;
only then were the two queens
of equal value. After the trade,
Black has the better of it, since
the a-pawn is weak, and the pawns
at e5 and £4 hem in White's bi-
shop. Summarizing the course of
the struggle through the opening
and a@iadiecane, we could say that
White's powerful and consistent
play netted him an advantage,
which he might have exploited
with 20 Rfbi; on the 21st move,
White might have maintained ap-
proximate equality, or if Black
were careless, a pretty combina-
tion could have been played. Hav~
ing let slip all these opportun-
ities, White must now endure a
difficult endgame.

be very difficult for Black to
bring his king to the center,
39.. £6 being met by 40 e6. In
the pawn endgame after 38.. B:d2
39 K:d2, the draw is clearer yet:
for example, 39.. K£8 40 Kc3 Ke7
41 Kb4 Kd7 42 Kc5. White would
not have had this chance, if
Black had played 34.. Rb5 instead
of 34.. Ral — yet another exam-
ple demonstrating how one must
always note and exploit the tin-
iest details in an endgame, and
how useful it can be to know
problem ideas.

Now the exchange of bishops
does not come off, since Black

41. Taimanov—Averbakh
(Nimzoindian Defense)


One of the tournament's most
interesting games, characterized
by White's persistent efforts to
clear a path, by combinative
means, for his fianchettoed
queen's bishop to reach the weak-
ened kingside dark squares. Pre-


[66]


sentday defensive technique be-
ing what it is, however, the ex-
ploitation of a single weakness
is not enough to win. White
therefore had to accumulate other
small advantages as well; at the
decisive moment, all were neces-
sary for the conclusive combina-
tion. The game acquires special
interest, due to Averbakh's ex-
ceptionally staunch and resource-
ful defense: at one point, it
looked as though he had weath-
ered every threat, but just then
White found the means of reviving
his attack. The finish was quite
pretty.

When Taimanov played this same
line with Black against Szabo in
the following round, White con-
tinued 8 Qe2, and Black was una-
ble to save his king's bishop
from exchange, whereas here he
could have played it back to dé.
Averbakh, being unwilling to
lose the time, gives up the bi-
shop for the knight, to open his
fianchettoed bishop's diagonal
by trading pawns on c4; only
thereafter does he counterattack
White's center with his pawn on
c5 and strategically placed
pieces.


This plan is harmless eoue
to leave White's hands free for
operations on both flanks.

White quietly prepares e3-e4,
for which Black has no better
remedy than mechanical preven-
tion. If he places his bishop on
e4, then White can play 13 Bfl
(which would have been impossi-
ble after 12 Qe2), and the com-
ing Nf£3-d2 will make it impos-
sible for Black's bishop to keep
White's pawn on e3 for long.

.. Re7, .- Qa8, .. Rfc8, and
.. N£8 would have made a more
rational defensive setup. A
knight on £8 is one of the most
economical ways of defending h/7,
and sometimes g7. The knight is
much less well placed on £6 for
defensive purposes, since it can
be more easily attacked and driv-
en away. The Qa8/Bb7 battery
would not only control the a8-
e4 diagonal, but might also
threaten the pawn on g2 in cer-
tain lines. By removing his
knight from d/, Black also gives
e5 over too soon, Averbakh later
concludes that the knight has to
return.

Before continuing with his

tension; by opening the a-file,
he also greatly increases the
scope of his rooks.

Black has a number of defenses
to this direct threat of mate. The
problem is not so much the threat

er se as the nature of the posi-
tional advantage White will de~
rive from Black's various replies.
19.. Be4 suggests itself, but then
there comes 20 Redi, and the line-
up of queen on d8, knights on a7


[67]


and d6, and rook on di would be
none too comfortable for Black.
Tf 19.. h6, then 20 Ng4, with
the powerful threat 21 N:h6+,
either immediately or after a
preparatory d4-d5; and 19.. £5
would deprive Black of the pos-
sibility of defending his king
position at some future time by
means of .. £7-f£6. Averbakh did
not want to bring the knight back
to £6, because after 20 Qh3 he
would still have to consider such
threats as 21 Ng4 and 21 d5; on
£6 the knight is exposed, and
may easily be driven away from
the defense of h7, as we have
seen. The continuation Averbakh
selects obviously weakens the
dark squares, but he had a con-
crete variation in mind which
brings a white pawn to e5, and
thereby denies White's bishop
access to the squares f6, g7 and
h6. Indeed, after

20. Qh5-h6 Nd7:e5
21. d4:e5 Nd6-e4


any retreat of the white king's
bishop allows 22.. Qd2, and in
this position, with its immobil-
ized pawn chain, White's bishops
would pose no problem. But Tai-
manov's brilliant


22. Bd3:e4


ushers in a new and truly grand-
masterly phase of the struggle,
wherein both sides will have am-
ple opportunity to display fan-
tasy, calculation and technique.


22. See Bb7:e4
23. Rel-di Rce7=-d7


Thinking that the d-file
threats had been met and that
White would no longer be able
to reach Black's king after the
exchange of rooks, Averbakh of-
fered a draw. No doubt White's
self-evident reply must have es-
caped him completely.


24. Rdi-d6 eee


White has taken over the d-
file! If Black now exchanges
rooks and stops the mate by
25.. £6, then the other rook
enters Black's position via the
a-file White was farsighted en-
ough to have opened back on the
18th move.


24, obs Be4-b7
25. Rat-di ies

There are players who think
"such moves cannot be bad"; cu-
riously, however, this move is
a clear loss of tempo. After
25.. R:d6, White recaptures with
the pawn, not the rook, and for
that he does not need a rook on
di. In order to keep up the pace
of his attack, Taimanov should
have substituted either 25 e4
or 25 h4,
25. Rd7:d6

Passive defense would allow
White to strengthen his position
decisively. One way would be to
play e3-e4 and then transfer the
rook via d3 to h3; another might
be to bring the bishop via cl and
g5 to £6. In either event, f2-f4-
£5, intending further exposure of
Black's king, would be a useful
plan.

26. e5:d6 £7-f£6

Now the ai-h8 diagonal is
blocked, and Black needs only
one move, 27.. Qd7, to parryhis
opponent's main threats.


27. d6-d7

A powerful move! The pawn ad-
vances to certain death, but it
will destroy the coordination of
the black pieces. While Black oc-
cupies himself in dealing with
the pawn, White's pieces will
take up still more active posi-
tions.


{68}


Let's make it White’s move
here. Do you see a pretty queen
sacrifice? — 28 Q:f8+ K:f8
29 B:f£6. To meet this threat,
Black could move his rook to f7,
attacking the pawn as well, but
then we get the echo-variation
28 Qh3 £5 29 Qh6 R:d7 30 Qg7+
(the queen sacrifices itself on
a different dark square)30..R:g7
31 R:d8+. Black's move draws the
sting from the threatened 28 Q:f8+4
since he can now meet 28.. K:f8
29 B:f6 with 29.. Q:d7.

27. Bb7-c6

I believe there was a more
radical solution to the problem
of defending the entire diagonal
in 27.. e5, which would also flow
quite logically from Black's last
few moves. For example:


I. 28 h4 R£7 29 h5 R:d7 30 R:d7

27.. Bc6é solves part of the
problem by getting rid of the
pawn on d/, but that's not en-
ough for this complex position.
Now Taimanov injects new life in-
to his attack: throwing his pawns
into the fray, he finally suc-
ceeds in breaking through to the
black king.

An idea peculiar to the King's
Indian: Black immediately joins
battle for d4, inviting White to
push his pawn to d5 with gain of
time. What does this lead to, how-
ever? One fianchettoed bishop be-
gins irritating White's most sen-
sitive spots, while its opposite
number gets walled in behind its
own pawn. There would be some
point to 7 d5 if the knight had
to return to b8 or at least to go
to e5, when White could exchange
knights and then set up a major-
ity attack with his queenside
pawns. But the knight goes to a5
instead, from which it can never
be driven: for instance, 7 d5Na5

Najdorf wearies of this obsti-

at the d4-pawn, he retreats his
bishop, so that now, after e2-e3
etc., Black's queen will no long-
er come out to f6 with an attack
on the bishop at £3. If White was
in some way forced to exchange
his d-pawn for Black's b-pawn,
then Black has gained a signal
strategical success in the open-
ing, for the two pawns are worlds
apart in value.

A serious positional error; just
how serious it is will be made
clear to the reader by the expla-
nation which follows.


Black controls an open queen-
side file, and can easily force
White to play b2-b3. After that,
his plan will be to advance his
a-pawn to attack the pawn at b3.
This plan can only succeed if
Black can support his pawn to a4,
but with what? He no longer has
his lightsquare bishop, and his
last move deprived his knight of
its proper square. It will also

become clear quite soon that
his knight cannot be maintained
on d4 for long, and the light
squares on the queenside are
under the control of White's
fianchettoed bishop — thus,
Black's knights have no good
squares, As a matter of fact,


Black's knights end up in pitiable


positions.


Thus, Black has no plan with a


future to it. He can make moves —


some of them, no doubt, will be
fairly good; he still need not
lose the game, but he has already
lost the guiding thread, so his
position is consequently infer-
ior. We recommend that the read-
er study this game in conjunction
with the Najdorf — Geller game
from. Round 28, There Black played
12.. Rb4!, and followed this up
with .. Ne5, inducing both f2-f4
and b2-b3; then he re-positioned
his knight on c5, and, despite
Najdorf's resourceful counter-
play on the queenside, carried
out the required attack on the
pawn at b3.

Black has done all one could
ask: he has induced 16 b3 and
advanced his pawn to a5 — what
he can do further, however, is
a mystery. Nor can one find any


advice to offer him, other than
to avoid weaknesses and not to
leave pieces en prise (which was
the iyiaci pie perind such moves
as 18.. Nd8 and 19.. Kh8). Mean-
while, White is all set for many
moves' worth of straightforward,
logical strengthening of his po-
sition: for example, Na4, Bc3 and
the exchange of bishops, followed
by £2-f4, Bf£3, Kg2, h3-h4-h5, Rhi,
etc. This is only a sketch, of
course; in actual play, Black
would not likely stand still, but
there can be no denying that all
the chances in this fight would
be with White, the more so in
that any attempt to bring the
pawn at e7 into the fight would
result in an irreparable weaken-
ing of the pawn at d6.

bishop is ong2 not d3. This cir-
cumstance promises Black better
chances from his idea of .. Nb8-

is less effective here, and
White has spent an extra tempo

Bravery, verging on bravado:
Black cannot take on b2 or on
d5, in view of the terrific
threat of 18 N:c4, when the pawn
at d6 must fall as well. Najdorf
must hold on to c4 at all costs,
while simultaneously keeping
track of how many pieces are at-
tacking and defending his pinned
knight on f6.


17. as Rb8-b4

18 Qf3 leads to nothing: after
the surprising 18.. Nce:d5, it is
Black who wins.


DRAW


It's hard to predict who might
have won, had the game continued,
but certainly a draw would have
been the least likely outcome.


Najdorf offered the draw be-
cause he considered his position
insecure, and Averbakh may have
agreed because he could not see
precisely how he was going to re-
cover his pawn. The players
should have exchanged places —
more than likely, they would
have continued the game then.
Najdorf gave the following var-
iations to justify the draw:
18.. Baé 19 Bfl ho 20 N:f£6+B:f6,
followed by either 21 B:h6 Re8
22 R:e8+ Q:e8 23 Nic4 Bicd
24 B:c4 B:b2 25 Rc2, or the bet-
ter line 21 B:f6 Q:f£6 22 Ne4 Qd8
23 Qd2 Kh7 24 Qf4 Ne8 25 Rc2,
with even chances.


It seems to me that 18 Rcl
was the mistake: the rook stood
well on the a-file too. A good
move with the same idea of at-
tacking the c-pawn would have
been 18 Bfi, especially since
the bishop does not defend the
d-pawn anyway. In this line,
almost every white piece would
stand well, and the threat of
19 Qf£3 would be strengthened. A
rough idea of the seriousness of
the pin on Black's king's knight
may be gathered from the follow-
ing variation: 18 Bfl Ba6é 19 R:a6
N:a6 20 Q£3, and there is no fur-
ther defense available for f6
(the proper move would be
18 .. B£5, and not 18.. Ba6).

But what's this? The High Priest
of Theoreticians himself, making
the sort of move to baffle his
opponent, and the reader too —
and to what end? Firstly, to hin-
der the usual .. £7-£5; secondly,
to swing the knight over to g3,
and only then to play f2-f4, since
this advance would be premature
here (it was Tarrasch's opinion
that £2-f£4 is nearly always pre-
mature); and thirdly, to push the
pawn up to g5, if circumstances
warrant.


These are the surface points
of 15 g4, but we may also guess
at something bolder: to station
the knight on g3 and the bishop
on e2, and at the right moment
go over to the assault with h3-
h4-h5... It's amazing that a move
with so many good ideas behind it
could be bad, but there is so
much piece tension in the center
that such a wing attack cannot
succeed. White does not even get
time enough to bring his knight
to g3, to say nothing of his oth-
er castles in the air.

46. Stahlberg—Bronstein
(Queen’s Indian Defense)


Stahlberg is a most enjoyable
opponent for the King's Indian
enthusiast, since he generally
prefers sharp, lively continua-
tions over theoretical lines.
However, he played the White side
of the King's Indian so strongly
against Boleslavsky in Round One
that I could not muster the cour-
age to repeat that opening ag-
ainst him. So I managed instead
to pick another system that he
knows very well, from which he
secured a sizable advantage.

The point to this check is that,
of the three possible piece inter-
positions, none is any good:7..Nbd7
is met by 8 cd ed 9 Ne5; 7..Qd7
is met by 8 Qc2, and the coming
Ne5 will gain a tempo; and fin-
ally, if the other knight cov-
ers, its colleague is deprived
of its natural square. Thus,

Black must use his pawn, which
closes the bishop's diagonal tem-
porarily. Stahlberg immediately
exchanges on d5, forcing the e-
pawn recapture, which in turn
practically forces an eventual
..c6-c5.

Black closes the bishop's di-
agonal, taking advantage of the


fact that White will be a long

into play at £4. A nearly sym-

White's lightsquare bishop is

still the more actively devel-
oped.

This is the sort of position in
which White is lost despite his
being a pawn ahead. His minor
pieces are scattered, his c-pawn
is weak, and his rooks are subject
to the harassment of the beauti-
fully coordinated black bishops.

The c-pawn is doomed; the only

able to get any sort of compen-

for example, to be able to ar-
range a trade of knight for bi-

minor pieces. (One complicating
factor is that, as a result of
the unusual opening, both sides

The beauty of this move becomes

serves its exclamation mark, but
so does his previous move, which
drove Black's king to the sev-
enth rank. Had White played 42 Rd6
immediately (with the black king
on g8), Black would have played
42.. £5 and won after 43 Rd8+

cution of White's plan, then, re-
quired a black pawn at f7.


Having safely weathered the
worst of the storm, White finds
little to fear in the rest of it:
by giving up his a-pawn, he se-
cures Black's h=pawn in return,

In Samisch's Attack against the
Nimzo-Indian, the plans for both
sides are generally determined at
an early stage. White accepts
doubled pawns, with the c4-pawn
especially weak (one might al-
most say doomed) in order to fa-
cilitate a rapid usurpation of
the center by means of e3-e4,
leading to a kingside attack with
f2-£4 (-£5, if Black allows).
Master practice has shown that
Black gets good counterplay if
he gets time for .. £5, blocking
the king's wing; while White can
only carry his attack through if
he can neutralize Black's queen-


side activity and prevent .. f5.
White must play very energetically
to achieve his ends, and fromthis
standpoint, castling is a waste

of time here.

I don't see this as being any

be reinforcing White's kingside
threats. More in the spirit of
the system White has selected
would be 11 £4 £5 12 Ng3, with
threats of 13 d5 or 13 e5; or
11 Ng3 first. In any event,

White should be developing his

game in this direction, and not

queenside, where the queen is

so passive. If Black answers

the c-pawn, then 12 de be 13 Be3,

when White seizes the b- and d-

files and plays e5 with a very
strong game.
11. Qd8-c8

Smyslov spent about an hour
on this move, and found an ex-
cellent plan: he defends c6 and
a6, indirectly attacks the c-
pawn (after an eventual ..c5:d4),


and answers 12 de with 12.. Ne5.
12. Bel-e3 d7-d6
13. Rai-dl Ne6-a5
14, d4:c5 mee
In the new situation, this ex-


change is not justified, since
Black has had time to play 12..d6
and can now recapture with the d-
pawn. From Geller, one might soon-
er have expected 14 d5!; although
he might lose the c-pawn later,
this is not all that important —
one pawn is not necessarily the


game. White would also have ob-
tained fair kingside chances then.

Of course, White will not ex-

tion.

White retreats into passive de-
fense, which renders his game stra-

tegically lost. Instead, he might
have played 17 ef N:f6 18 Bg5
B:c4 19 B:£6 B:d3 20 R:d3 R:f6

21 c4, keeping the knight out of
c4 and setting up strong pressure
along the d-file. Black's win in
that case would have been far from
simple: for instance, 21.. Raf8

g3-e4.

The point to this fine queen
maneuver is that by threatening
to win the c-pawn Black gains
time to deny White's knight the
square h5, and forces White's
bishop to the inferior square b3,
where it will be completely out
of play. Now White cannot return
his bishop to d3.

White's next move exploits an
accidental tactical chance — the
somewhat exposed state of Black's
king — to bring the queen over


to the kingside. However, this
has no material effect on the out-
come, since the best White can
achieve out of an attack on the
king with his lone queen is an
exchange of queens and an obvi-


ously lost endgame.

One of many "possible, though
not best" continuations. Its ap-
parent goal — to place the bi-
shop at bl, the queen at _c2 and
mate the black king on h7?7 — is
too lightweight; while its true


aim — advancing the pawns to

c4 and d5, opening the diagonal
for the fianchettoed white
queen's bishop — is somewhat
convoluted, since these same
pawns also close up the diagonal
of his other bishop.


I think White should play here
moves which support the push e3-
e4-e5.

Looking at its structure alone
without regard to the time fac-

could play Khi, Rg1, Bb2, Bbl,
etc. The trouble is that Black
has completed his development be-
fore White, and can begin his
attack first: already he threat-
ens 16.. Qh3 and .. Ne/7-g6-h4. As
a result, White must resort to
desperate measures in order to
avert a swift catastrophe.

A stock position illustrating
the strength of the two knights
and their advantage over the two
bishops. One bishop is locked in
a cell measuring a3 by cl by e3;
the other is chained to the pawn
at £3. Both bishops are absolute-
ly impotent, and White has no
useful moves. The knights will
continue to dominate the bishops
as long as the pawn chain re-
mains immobile, so White's best
chance was to retreat the bi-


shop to c2 in an attempt to open
the game.

Taimanov easily acquired a passed

By itself, certainly, it would
cause Black no great discomfort;
but if it were to receive a bit
of support, its power would grow
by leaps and bounds.


21 £4 would have been very much
to the point here: however Black
might reply, he could not prevent
the appearance of the pawn-pair

have had, if Black had not been
so hasty with his 20.. £5. 20..Rae8
was still possible, with ..f5 only

rush matters (since White could

then be completely mobilized.

A memorable move indeed. Tai-
manov is the great optimist of
the chessboard, always happy with
his position, and sometimes a
trifle slow to sense approaching
difficulties. However, when the
wolf is at the door, his resource-
fulness, combined with his far-
seeing powers of calculation,
draws from the deepest reserves
of his position such possibili-
ties as to astound not only his
opponent, but chess fans every-
where.


The plan he comes up with here
dooms all five of his central
pawns, in order to reach a posi-
tion in which rook and two rook
pawns successfully hold off rook
and four pawns.

Advising is always easier than
playing the game oneself. A more
stubborn defense was 37 Ra7, win-
ning control of the seventh rank,
but to refuse the c-pawn, with a
two-pawn deficit? One can only
advise such moves... Nevertheless,
the outcome would not have been
all that clear, even with Black's
two extra pawns: in order to free
his king, Black would have had to
give back his a-pawn. After that,
White's task would be to trade off


[84]


his a-pawn for Black's c-pawn,
throwing in his h-pawn as well,
if necessary: sometimes one can
draw the ending against the f-
and h-pawns.


After 35 R:c5, White also gets
his rook to a7, but Black keeps
his a-pawn. The main objection
to 35 R:c5, however, is that
White doesn't even win his pawn


back, since Black's .. Rd4-

two-pawn margin.

We all know the basic idea of
the Grunfeld is to attack the
pawn center, and especially the
d-pawn; so why does Black streng-
then d4 and open the b-file for
White, without being forced to
do so?


There are many reasons for it,
chief among them the fact that
the knight had no good retreat
square. Additionally, Black does
not lose a tempo, and he removes
a strong enemy knight. If the b-
file is opened, the c-file isal-
so closed; he may be strengthen-
ing the d-pawn, but he is also
isolating the a-pawn, and weak-


ening the b-pawn by bringing it
to c3 and detaching it from its
pawn chain. So 6.. N:c3 does
have its logic.


Pe b2:¢c3

Of course, Black will have a
difficult time collapsing d4,
but that is not to say it will
be impossible. One of the pecul-
iarities of central pawn tension
is that Black may trade on d4 at
any suitable moment, while White
can almost never take on c5. On
the other hand, as we shall note
more than once, the move 7.. c)3
enhances the power of White's
fianchettoed bishop.

10.. Na5 would have been in the

clear, effective plans: it at~
tacks the weakened square c4,
with a natural followup something
like 11.. Bd7, 12.. cd 13.. Rc8,
14.. Bc6, etc. The text move could
have been met powerfully 2 11 a4,
threatening 12 Ba3, when White's
position would glow with all the
colors of the rainbow. (Ba3 must
not be played too hastily, how-
ever: 11 a4 Rd8 12 Ba3 Bg4, and
the bishop's diagonal has to be
closed by 13 £3, since 13 Bic5
allows 13.. Q:c5. So the right
move would be 11 a4 Rd8 12 Qb3,
and then 13 Ba3.)

In Morphy's time, such a move

White has apparently attained

four sides at once, and his cen-

White has much the worse of it.
He cannot take on b7 with his
queen (14 Q:b7? Rab8 15 Qe7 Q:c3,
and White loses a whole piece),
nor with his bishop (for the
same reason: 14 B:b7 Rab8& 15 Qd5
BE3 or 15.. R:b7, etc., with an
irresistible attack). White's
only chance to equalize is toset
up the formation Nd5 and e3-e4,

Szabo's hot-blooded nature re-
jects the strong positional line
17.. Qa6, although it is wholly
logical and embodies a number of
healthy ideas: controlling the
light squares, severely weakened
by the exchange of the fianchet-
toed bishop; defending the ,b-
pawn; increasing the queen's
radius of activity; and impeding
the development of the knight,
ae 18 Nd5 would be met by

- Qe2!


The strength of 17.. Qa6 lies
not merely in abstract ideas, but
also in concrete variations: for
example, 18 Qa3 Qc4, or 18 Ba3 b6,
or 18 Be3 c4 19 Qc2 Nd3. If 18 £3,
the weakening of the second rank
must tell sooner or later (see
Game 85, Stahlberg - Szabo).


Szabo's bumptious 17.. b5 leads
almost by force to an equal end-
game.

If one desires an explanation
of such quick draws, which occur
in every tournament, one must keep
in mind that such an event lasts
more than one day. Many things
happen over the course of thirty
rounds that have a bearing onthe
fighting abilities of the people
who play chess. In the present
case, Petrosian's peaceable dis-
position and Averbakh's too, in
part, may have been due to the
previous round, which went badly
for both. After the extra rest
day they gave themselves with
this eighth-round game, Petro-
sian went on to win three straight
games in good style (an excep-
tional achievement by any stan-
dard in such a strong tourney);


while Averbakh, though perhaps
not quite so fortunate, still
fought with great verve in the
rounds that followed.


In major tournaments, one
must ration one's strength, not
for the individual game, but for
the entire event, taken as a
whole. The history of chess ev-
ents — and that of many other
sports as well — contains many


(87)


cases in which one of the parti-
cipants forged ahead at the out-
set, only to lose game after game
towards the end (and not against
his most powerful opponents, ei-
ther), finishing far behind the
winners.

The direct and most natural
attempt to solve the problem
of the queen's bishop. For a
long time, White used to get
the better of it with 8 cd ed
9 Ne5; Pillsbury won a number
of games that way. The system
was revived recently when Bon-
darevsky and Makogonov decided
that after 7.. b6 it made lit-
tle sense to block the diagonal
a8-hi1 with a pawn; so they be-
gan recapturing, after 8 cd,
with the knight instead. Now,
should White reply to 8.. N:d5
with 9 B:e/7 Q:e/7 10 N:d5, so
that Black must suffer a pawn
on d5 anyway, then the bishop
shows its flexibility by devel-
oping to e6, rather than to b/7.
Thus, the Bondarevsky-Makogonov
Defense proves completely vi-
able, and now on occasion it is
White who, as here, deviates
from the main line.

out fearing 11.. N:c3 12 B:d8

Black has brought out all his

ment is far from complete. He
will have a hard time finding

pieces, while White's rooks and
queen are developing very nice-
ly. The text move prepares the
maneuver 12.. de 13 Bsc4 b53 then
14.. Qb6, followed by the devel-
opment of the rooks to c8 and d8.
Black still loses an important
tempo, however, when 11.. dc
12 B:c4 Ne4 would have eased his
defense.

Recapturing with the knight
would have suited the spirit of
this opening better: if then
13 B:e7 Q:e7 14 N:d5 B:d5, with
a comfortable game for Black. On
15 e4, the bishop simply retreats
to b7, while if 15 B:a6, Black
could recapture at a2, although
I would prefer 15.. B:f3 16 ef
cd 17 ed Nf6, with good pros-
pects, now that the knight has
the d5 and f4 squares.


Petrosian probably disliked

Black's hanging pawns are weak.
Szabo carries out a typical ma-
neuver, Bd3-c2-b3, in order to
induce the advance of one pawn,
which weakens the other, and
gives White an important central
support point.


16. ee c5o-c4


17. Bb3-a4 prea

Now, with the knight pinned a-
gainst the rook, White threatens
18 B:f£6 as well as 18 B:d7 and
19 N:d5, forcing Petrosian to
trade off one of the d-pawn's
defenders. However, Szabo should
not have contented himself with
this, when he had an opportunity
to combine his attack on the d-
pawn with threats to Black's
king. Having induced Black to
play his bishop to c6, he ought
to have brought his bishop back
to c2, thus: 17.. Bc6é 18 Bc2!
Rab8 19 Nd4 Ba8 20 Rb1, and
Black's game creaks at every
joint: White is threatening both
21 Bg3 and 21 NE£5.


17. ate Bb7-c6
18. Ba4:c6 Qb6:c6
19. b2-b3 o 46


Szabo has been bitten by a
fatal idea: to attack the d5-
pawn on the c4 square. With
this one thoughtless move 1)
he weakens an entire cluster
of dark squares in his posi-
tion; 2) he knocks the supports
out from under his queen's
knight; and 3) he makes Black's
bishop better by giving it the
chance to move out either to b4
or to a3.


Either 19 Nd4 and 20 NE£5,
or 19 Rc2 and 20 Red2 would have
been correct here. The pawn
stood quite well at b2, and it
should not have been disturbed.


19, eee Ra8-c8
20. Nc3-a4 eee


This must have been the result
of a miscalculation, since the
knight returns at once; but the

while, and now White must con-
sider how to defend his knight
on c3.

Szabo goes overboard in his
desperate attempt to hold the |

This position illustrates the
power of the pin, based on the
unprotected rook at cl.


27. aes Nf6-e8
The point of this pretty move


is easily seen: Black brings
this knight to d6, freeing the


square f6 for the bishop. From
there, the bishop will attack,
not only the rook at d4, but
also the knight, if it should
move from a4 to b2. 27.. Nd7
would have been an error, in
view of 28 Rc2! Ne5 (the knight
blocks the diagonal of the bi-
shop, giving White time to de~
fend) 29 Nab2, and the rook on
c2 sidesteps to the d-file; on
28.. B£6 29 R:d7? would be a

Aggressive treatment of the
opening. If Black wants to break
the pin, he must do it at once,
as otherwise White will put his
queen on d2, rendering .. h/7-h6
impracticable. And if the pin is
not broken, then White will move
his bishop to h6 and without fur-
ther ado push his h-pawn — a
serious, though hardly a fatal,
threat. From a purely chessic
viewpoint, then, the logical move
was certainly 7.. d6.


[90]

















This pawn sortie combines two
strategic ideas: restraint of
Black's queenside development,
and cutting the communications
between the two wings of Black's
position. Additionally, White
gains the valuable square d5 for
both bishop and knight.


Black's retarded development
is due chiefly to the fact that
the pawn which is now nailed to
d7 closes the diagonal c8-h3,
which means that the bishop now
can only get into play on b7 or
a6. But 9.. b6 is not yet play-
able; first the knight must be
played to c6. Thus, we can deduce
that Black's next three moves
will be: 9.. Nc6, 10.. b6, and
11.. Bb?7.


Black's queenside pieces can
only reach the kingside by way
of the square d8, which puts
quite a crimp on their maneuver-
ability.


These are the positive aspects
of 9 dé. There is only one nega-
tive aspect: cut off from sup-
port, this pawn may die. White's
task is therefore to assail the
kingside with might and main for
as long as the pawn at dé stands,
depriving Black's kingside of the
necessary support of his queen-
side pieces. This task Euwe car-
ries out in brilliant style.

In his later commentary, Najdorf

It seems to me, however, that in
that event the kingside attack
would have developed more quick-
ly and more dangerously.

We would like to draw the read-

an exclamation mark, simply be-
cause we had already given one to
White's previous move.


14. Bc8=-b7


Naturally, Black doesn't even
think of saving the exchange, nor
would White dream of taking it:
after 15 Nf7+ R:f7 16 B:f7 Nb4
the initiative would pass to
Black.

15. g3-g4 eee

White continues methodically
clearing the approaches to the
black king. On 15.. Na5, White
could trade bishops and play his
queen to d5, with two threats:
18 Q:b7 and 18 N£7+; and on
15.. Qf6, White has the choice
between 16 Nf£f7+, attacking the
queen and winning the exchange
after 16.. R:£7 17 g5, or l6ef
Q:£5 17 Rh2.

15. eae e5-e4

Black is not opening the h8-
al diagonal in order to capture
the b-pawn, but in order to allow
his king to hie himself to g7,
after which perhaps Black could
risk capturing the knight. But
now a white knight gets to f4.


16. Ngi-e2 Bg7:b2
17. Ne2-£4 ‘fate
White, in turn, also sacrifices


the exchange. Couldn't Black take
it? That question cannot be ans-
wered with variations. White has
a myriad of appealing attacking
continuations. To examine one:
17.. B:al 18 gf Bc3+ 19 Kf1 is
similar to what actually occurred;


[91]


and it would seem to me that
White's threats — 20 N:g6+,

20 Qg4, etc. — would be impos-
sible to withstand, especially
under tournament conditions. Naj-
dorf was apparently of the same
opinion: before anything else,
he aims to shore up the key point
g6. (A note here: White's attack
would congeal very quickly if he
limited his sacrifice to the ex-
change: 18 Q:ait+? Qf6 19 N:got+

Since White must attain one of
the important squares (g6, h6 or
h5) in any event, Najdorf decides
to take the rook after all, since
this might later allow him to give
up his queen for two pieces or a
piece and a pawn. On 18.. ef,
White would have continued 19 Rbi
Be5 20 Qh5, with a tremendous at-
tack. The next phase of the game
puts one in mind of those ancient
clashes of the masters of the It-
alian School.


19,
20.


N£4:g6+ Kh8-¢7
Ng5:e4 eee


White is practically advertis-
ing that his attack is intuitive,
rather than calculated — other-
wise, why would he need the e-
pawn? The simple 20 Nf4, setting
up such fearsome threats as 21 Nh5+,
21 Qh5 and 21 Rgl, seems more ap-
pealing, yet Euwe didn't play it.
Why? To put it simply, Euwe did
not want to give his opponent a
choice. White's 20 N:e4 forces


matters: by depriving Black's
queen of the square c3, it elim-
inates the variation 20 NE4 Qc3+
21 Kf1 — although, in my opin-
ion, this would only improve
White's position. For example:
21.. R:£5 22 Qg4; or 21.. hg
22 he R:£5 23 Rh7+. But —well,
Euwe received a brilliancy prize
for this game; the judges were
not too strict, and we shall not
go nitpicking either. Each grand-
master has his own style, with
its strengths and weaknesses.

20. Bat-c3+

White has a very strong posi-
tion, but he is still a whole
rook down. 20.. Q:£5 was bad:
White would have won right off
with 21 Q:al+ K:g6 22 Rgi+. So
first Black pulls his bishop
out with check, and then he
takes the f-pawn, putting pres-
sure on f2 and removing the
protection of the knight at g6.


21.
22.


Kei-f1 Qf6:£5
Ng6-£4 oes

Black needs only another move
or two to stabilize his position
and escape with his extra rook,
but these must be good moves.
Thus, 22.. Be5 would be answered
by 23 Ng3 Qh7 24 Qg4+ Kh8 25 Ng6+;
if the queen goes to e5 instead,
White's queen checks at g4; and
if the bishop retreats to f6, then
either 23 Ng3 or 23 Rgit+ wins. I
believe that Black must lose here
even with the best defense. (Had
he wished, White could have forced
a draw with 22 Rgl, after which
Black must play 22.. Qh3+23 Rg2
Qhi+ 24 Rel Qh3+, etc.)


22. os Kg7-h8!

This is a good move. White must
take the bishop now, giving his
opponent a breath of air, since
the consequences of 23 Rgl are
unclear,

23. Ne4:c3 Ra8-e8

But instead of this move,

23.. Nd8 was necessary: the bi-

ing. Variations like 24 B:b7N:b/7

( Position after 22.. Kh8!)
have made it very difficult for
White, but I believe he might
still have turned the trick with
25 Ned5! in the first variation,
instead of the somewhat flaccid
25 Nce2. The pawn on d6 can be
let go now, since it has already
done its work. Beyond a doubt,
however, Euwe's 20 N:e4 put a
damper on his attack, whereas
Najdorf in turn failed to capi-
talize on his good fortune.

There has been no mate as yet,
and the material is still even,
but the bishop on b7 and the
knight on c6 are still mere by-
standers; it is this last cir-
cumstance that allows White the
opportunity to re-form his troops
into a new attacking wave and send
them in once again to assault the
black king's broken position.

( Position after 21.. Rc2 )


An instructive position which
shows us:


1) why, when only one bishop re-
mains, we are told to place our
pawns on squares of opposite col-
or. This gives the bishop pawn-
trenches to traverse: for exam-
ple, if White had the light-
squared bishop, he would have a
fully acceptable game, whereas
here his position is hopeless.


2) why it is so clearly advan- |
tageous to trade off the enemy's
fianchettoed bishop: the square
g2 is very weak, and the usual
technique of queen to £3, fol-
lowed by pawn to h5-h4-h3 pro-
mises a swift end for White.


3) the importance of seizing
the seventh (or second) rank,
or even a single square of it.
Black could have won two pieces
for a rook here with 21.. Ricl
22 Ri:c1 N:d2, but instead, he
simply placed his rook on c2.
On the second rank, the rook
restricts the enemy pieces, and
also sets up sundry combinations,
as we shall observe later on.


22. Nd2:e4 d5:e4
23. a2-a3 sata


Black could have wound the game
up here by 23.. Qd3 24 Q:d3 ed.
This threatens to win the bishop,
which has yet to make a single
move; and if 25 Rdi, then25..Re2,
when the pawn cannot be taken be-


cause of 26.. Rel+, winning the
unfortunate bishop. If White, in
reply to 23.. Qd3, avoids the ex-
change of queens by playing 24 Qa4,
the simple 24.. b3 underscores his
utter helplessness: for example,
25 Q:a7 BE8 26 a4 Re2 27 Rf1 Rec2
28 aS R:f2 29 R:f2 Qd1+ 30 Kg2
Qf3+. However, the text is not a
bad idea either.

A strange optical illusion!
Theory holds that the exchange
of queens leads by force to a
favorable endgame for White,
while retreating his queen to
b6é is bad because of 14 Na4 Qc6
15 BbS Q:g2 16 Rgi. This isall
true, but only with the black
pawn at h7! Then, indeed, after

- Q:e5 14 fe NdS 15 B:e7N:e7
16 Bd3, Black could not play
16.. Bd7 because of 1? B:h7+
K:h7 18 R:d7; Black would have
to continue 16.. Nc6 17 Rhel,
when 17.. Bd7 is once more im-
possible, and White establishes
a bind. In the present game, how-
ever, with the pawn on h6é,
16.. Bd? is quite possible: af-
ter 17 Bh7+ K:h7 18 R:d7 Nc6,
the exchange of b-pawn for e-
pawn is not dangerous to Black,
as long as White is no great
endgame enthusiast — which Bo-
leslavsky is not.


Both players overlooked this,
and Gligoric played the novelty
he had prepared for the other
variation.

Black believes the free game he
gets for his bishops and rooks
compensates for his doubled, iso-
lated pawns; but in my opinion,
White must have the better of it.
He has a 3/2 pawn majority, with-
out the need to create a passed
pawn from it: the passed pawn is
already made for him! The closer
the endgame approaches, the more
the c-pawn's presence will be felt.

16.. Bc5 would give Black no-
thing, since after 17 Rgel, the

17 Rgel B:g2? 18 B:f6 gf 19 Rel,
winning the pair of bishops for
the rook. Nor is 16.. Bc5 17 Rgel
Nd5 attractive, since simplifica-
tions are generally unfavorable
to Black here; and besides, White
would stand a great deal better
after 18 N:d5 B:d5 19 Be4 B:e4
20 R:e4.

Taking on g2 would still be bad.
Perhaps moving the king to h8

16th move: Boleslavsky played it
himself in a later tournament.


19. £4-£5 ake

Without fearing 19.. B:c3,
which would give White a passed
pawn on the c-file. This obser-
vation might come as a surprise
to the reader, since White al-
ready has a passed pawn on c2.
Unfortunately for White, this
pawn cannot be considered passed
with so many pieces still on the
board, since it may not stir a
single step without upsetting the
king's disposition. If, however,
Black were to take the knight
here, then the c3-pawn, supported
by the bishop pair, could run for
daylight, while the c2-pawn re-
mained behind to shelter the king.

19. e6-e5

If Black was not happy with the
19,.. ef variation, then 19.. Nd5
was the obvious continuation in
order to play on the pin. This
move costs Black his last point
of support in the center, and
the passed e-pawn is no compen-
sation.


20. Bd3=b5 Re8-e7
21. Rel-e3 a7-aoé
22. Bb5-a4 Bb4-c5


The pawn at g2 has been indi-
rectly defended all this time by
the black king's location on the
g-file (.. B:g2; B:f6! gf; Rel,
pinning the bishop); had the king
gone to £8 here, there might have
followed 23 a3 B:c3 24 Ric3 Big2
25 Rg3 and 26 Rdgl, and now itis
Black who finds his g-pawn hard
to protect. However, the text
move also says that Gligoric is
unable to find a plan to improve
his position. Meanwhile, Bole-
slavsky proceeds, in the straight-
forward style characteristic of
him, to engineer a minor-piece
trade, seize control of d5, and
force the further advance (and
further weakening) of the e-pawn.

The four-rook endgame makes
White's advantage very clear.


[96]


Black's rooks ride quietly at
anchor, defending their passed
pawn; but White's king stands so
near that it may easily get next
to the pawn, let's say to £3.
Should the e-pawn fall, then
White's win will become a matter
of time. Black's king can neither
come to the aid of its pawn, nor
counterattack the f-pawn. A fur-
ther demonstration of White's
possibilities is that, were it
his move here, then 32 c4, fol-
lowed by 33 Rc3, would leave
Black in a completely hopeless
predicament, with the rook onc3
simultaneously attacking the pawn
on e3 and supporting its own
passed pawn. Black's next move is
directed against this threat.

Tying the king down to the

— but the black king refuses
to be tied down! Black is giving
up both his f-pawns in order to
reach the square £3, which will
secure him the draw. Might this
possibility have been prevented?
Yes; the mistake was 34 g4, by
which White transferred the base
of his pawn chain from g2 to g4—
i.e., closer to Black's king. He
ought to have played 34 g3, with


excellent winning chances: for

this line, the winning idea is
not the capture of the e-pawn,
but the exchange of one pair of
rooks in order to secure maximum
activity for his other pieces.

DRAW


— after intensive analysis.


White must move his rook back
and forth along the d-file. Af-
ter 42 c5, he would lose, and
most instructively. White's king
must defend the rook on e2 and
the pawn on c4 at the same time;
the latter pawn protects the su-


[97]


premely important support point
at d5 for the rook, thus defend-
ing the king against checks on
the d-file. 42 c5 would allow
Black to double his rooks on the
fifth rank and drive off the
white king, thus: 42.. Ree5

43 c6 Rd5+ 44 Ke4 Rc5+ 45 Kd3
R£d5+ 46 R:d5 R:d5+ 47 Ke4 Rd2,
and Black wins. There are many
other combinative possibilities
in this ending after 42 c5?,

and all of them favor Black; but
as long as the pawn stands atc4,
the king at d3, and the rook cov-
ers the d-file, White can hold
the draw.

61. Kotov—Bronstein
(King’s Indian)

Everyone loves to attack the
king, but it is often hard to
decide on such an attack, espe~
cially when one's opponent can
counterattack on the opposite
wing. The problem is that al-
though the goal of the kingside
attack — mate to the enemy's
king — is more enticing, it is
also far more difficult to ach-
ieve than, for example, the cre-
ation of a few pawn weaknesses
by means of a queenside attack.
An attack on the king with pieces
alone requires overwhelming nu-
merical superiority and generally
a few sacrifices; and the pawns
cannot always join in the assault.
The present game is an example of
headlong opposite-wing counterat-
tacking. Watch how each side per-
sistently prevents the other's
pawn breaks, c4-c5 and .. f7-f5.
Kotov is the first to achieve his
goal, and his powerful passed pawn
at full career very nearly over-
powers the massed striking force
of the entire black army.

secure the square b55 in con-

throws all his other pieces to

knight, which is destined to

Black's previous error now

and now White wins easily with
46 Bb8, attacking the black
pawns from behind. Black would
have to continue 38.. Re8 in
order to avoid the main varia-
tion; on 39 a7, he would have
had to retreat his king to h7,
as in the game, but this would
have left White an important
tempo ahead, which he could
utilize by playing 40 Qc6, at-
tacking both rooks and threat-
ening to capture either one,


[99]


depending upon Black's reply. This
would have made matters much more
pleasant for White than they
turned out in the game.

The simplest way for Black to
win is to break through to the

accomplished in either of two
ways: by a piece sacrifice, or
by a flanking maneuver via d8

have played 44.. N:g3, but after

White had a choice between
7 Bd3 and 7 Bc4. The former,
aiming at quick development and
a piece attack on the kingside,
was in vogue twenty or thirty
years ago, up until a game be-
tween Botvinnik and Alekhine, in
which White played 7 Bc4 and won
a beautiful endgame. With 7 Bc4
White emphasizes that although
the black knight on d5 can con-
sider itself safe from pawns af-
ter the exchange on d4, it is
not safe from pieces, which
means it's not so well placed


[100]


on d5, after all.


However, the game Kotov-Leven-
fish (16th USSR Championship, Mos-
cow 1948) showed an antidote to
7 Bc4 as well: Black immediately
retreated his knight to b6, and
stubbornly refused to play ..c5:d4,
which would have allowed White to
open the diagonal ci-h6é for his
bishop with the recapture e3:d4
(this was the mistake Kotov made
in his game with Boleslavsky).
And, since White's bishop re-
mained on b3, he could not play
b2-b3, so that his queen's bishop
remained a constant source of
worry. At the present time, 7 Bd3
and 7 Bc4 enjoy approximately
equal reputations.

style, concrete and unprejudiced.
Undeterred by the gaping holes
he creates at £6 and h6, hecloses
off the dangerous diagonal bi-h7,
and prepares pressure on the pawn
at d4. Still, not every player
could allow himself such a style,
and not every player would enjoy
it so. I shall note right here
that, despite the draw Reshevsky
obtained in this game, he appears
to have been dissatisfied with
the opening, since in the second
half, against Szabo, he exchanged
knights on c3 in this position,
and then developed his bishop to
e7. A few moves later, however,
he played ..g7-g6 again. Since
Reshevsky did not employ this
variation a third time, it would
seem that the opening of the sec-
ond game was still less to his
liking.

9. Bel-g5 Qd8=-a5

Geller would undoubtedly have
answered 9.. Be7 with 10 h4.

10. 0-0

The sacrifice of a pawn after
a knight exchange on c3 is known
from many openings, especially
the Greco Attack of the Giuoco
Piano, which so delights the be-
ginner. In the present instance,
taking the c-pawn with his queen
would soon have left Black hope-
lessly placed after 12 Bfé.


10. BE8-g7


li. Nc3-e4


Geller skillfully masks his
true intentions: he would seem
to be threatening 12 Nd6+, when
in reality the knight is heading
for £6. Naturally, before this
point can be secured, he will
have to deal with the knight on
d5 and the bishop on g7.

Reshevsky plows unswervingly

the isolated d-pawn (this was
the other idea behind 8.. g6:
to allow the bishop to develop
to g7); however, no other play-
er I know of would have allowed
White his next two moves. Cour-
age alone is insufficient for
such a decision.

Why didn't the king walk out
of the check? Possibly because
of 15 Qd2, or the more forcing
15 N:d5 Q:b2 16 Bf6; more prob-
ably because Black had already
planned his 14.. B:f6 and
15.. Na5.

Many would have played 16 Qd2

slightly inferior ending after
16.. Q:£6 17 Q:a5; but as long
as Geller can attack, he will do
so. After 16 Qd2 Re8 is one of
the insufficient replies, in view
of 17 Be5, and if 17.. Nc4, then
18 Qh6, and now both 18.. N:e5
and 18.. £6 would be met by 19Ng5.
I would have preferred 16 Bg5,
intending to re-position the bi-
shop at ho: a bishop on that
square not infrequently gives
rise to some surprising combina-
tions.

17 Rei, with the same idea of

— most unexpectedly.


White , of course, would have
risked nothing by continuing his
fight for the initiative. His
pawn minus would have been vir-
tually meaningless, in view of
Black's insecure king.


White had several tempting con-
tinuations at his disposal: for
instance, I like playing the
knight to e5 when the black queen
is on c3. Also good is the sim-
ple 19 Bb4 Qc7 20 B:a5! Q:a5
21 Qcl, with fierce pressure. If
he wanted to force a draw, White
could always have done so later.
At any rate, Black should have
had to work a little for it.

A theoretical position which
occurs often in tournament play;
for example, Smyslov-Keres, Bu-
dapest 1950. Having put off
castling for so long, Black
ought to exercise his patience
a little longer in order to re-
move his queen from its danger-
ous opposition to the white rook,
to c7 or b6. With 10.. Be7 and
11.. b4, Black enters a line
which theory rightly considers
inferior for Black. On more than
one occasion, Keres has over-
thrown accepted opinion, infus-
ing new ideas into old varia-
tions: as examples, take his
games with Boleslavsky and
Stahlberg from this tournament.
Here, however, he plays a var-
iation of low repute without
having any improvement prepared,
and his heedlessness lands him
in immediate difficulties.*


10. avers BE8-e7
11. e3-e4 b5-b4

Of course! The knight has no-
where to go, so Black must enter
a line which leads by force to
the creation of a powerful white
passed pawn.

Beginning with this move, Smys-
lov carries out one idea with
iron determination and logic: the
minor pieces must clear a path
for the passed pawn. The knight
and the pair of bishops do not
defend the pawn; instead, they
attack the squares directly in
front of it. Seen in this light,





*tn 1959, Smyslov tried out a new
idea — 10..Bd6! — against Pet-
rosian, winning brilliantiy.





( Position after 14 d5)


the idea behind the move 16 Nd2
becomes clear: White intends to
post this knight on e4 or c4, at-
tacking the square d6.


As the further course of the
game shows, it was here that Ker-
es realized the enormity of his
error; for the remainder of the
game, he displayed amazing re-
sourcefulness, doing literally
everything possible to prevent
White from capitalizing on his
passed pawn.

—— 4,





Black's pawn sacrifice would
appear to have achieved some-
thing: White now finds it dif-
ficult to complete the develop-
ment of his queenside, since any
move of the queen's bishop (ex-
cept to b2 or g5, naturally) al-
lows 22..Qa3, winning back the
c“pawn.

22. Bci-f£4 atau

Anyway! This is a typical Smys-
lov move, combining the logical
completion of his idea with ac-
curate calculation of its tact-
ical consequences. White disre-
gards his c-pawn in order to se-
cure the forced march of his d-
pawn. We should like to draw the
reader's attention to the place-
ment of White's bishops, laying
down a crossfire in front of the
pawn.


On 22..Qa3, White achieves a
decisive advantage in the follow-
ing manner: 23 Bc6 B:c6 24 de

out rather like that, but with
White having spent an extra tem-
po (g2-g3) on his king's bishop's
development. Note how smoothly
Black's development proceeds

now. One cannot afford to ignore
the time element even in the qui-

What is wrong with White's
position? His c-pawn is dead;
his queen's knight is just
waiting passively for the stroke
of a pawn from b4; having a 3/2
queenside pawn majority, White
cannot make use of it, and is
reduced to playing with his king-
side pawns (which explains why
systems involving long castlin,
are so popular against the Sici-
lian: the pawns go precisely
where they are needed). Passive
play would soon involve White in
difficulties, so he sacrifices a
pawn for the sake of the initia-
tive: for example, 14.. N:g4
15 Qg3 h5 16 Khi, when the cen-
ter of gravity has shifted to
the kingside. This variation
was easy to accept; however, I
also had to be ready for the
sharp counterattack Black ac-~
tually undertook on the queenside.

— which each side evaluated in

With the white king's bishop
fianchettoed and the black e-
pawn advanced to e5 in this var-
iation, the moves 5.. a6 and
8.. b5 are not intended as part
of a queenside attack (since
there’s nothing there to attack),
but rather to gain space for the
black pieces: .. Bb? and ..Nb8-
d7-b6. From this point of view,
the bishop's deployment at e6
makes little sense. The bishop
later takes off for g4, and then
h5, as if reproaching Kotov for
making it idle aimlessly about
the board, instead of taking up
its station immediately on the
long diagonal.


The ..b7-b5-b4 push makes sense
only when Black has a pawn at e6
and White's knight is left with-
out a good retreat. But here,

.. b5=b4 will send the knight to
the excellent square d5, where
Black will be practically forced
to trade it off, extending the
diagonal of the fianchettoed
white king's bishop. These are
all the drawbacks of developing
the bishop at e6.

One general rule of chess stra-

before it is attacked. 13 a5
would have been good here, but
Gligoric is strongly opposed to
pushing pawns; he will decide to
play a4-a5 only several rounds
later, in Game 120 against Naj-
dorf.

14. c2-c3 b4:c3
15. Bd2:c3 Qd8-b6


White has an extra queenside
pawn, but making a passed pawn
with it would appear to be the
last thing on his mind; he wants
to do only what is necessary on
the queenside in order to free
himself to proceed with his at-


tack on the kingside. This was
the aim of the operation: 13 Bd2,
14 c3, and 15 B:c3. Black must
play very alertly in this sit-
uation — which he does, in
fact, postponing castling until
move 20 in order to blunt his
opponent's initiative.

16. h2-h3 Bg4-h5

The further course of the game
will give rise to the natural
question: shouldn't he have ta-
ken the knight immediately? Pro-
bably not. After 16.. B:e217Q:e2
Be7, White, with the two bishops
already in hand, would have had
no reason to undertake any sort
of kingside operation. It would
be a good idea then to remember
his a-pawn and prepare b2-b4 to
make it a passed one.

White has secured a definite
advantage, and has made all of
his preparatory moves; now the
time has come to solve the main
problem of which road to choose
in order to get to the win.


Sometimes it's enough merely
to play the so-called “reason-
able" and "natural" moves: oc-
cupy the open files with your
rooks, move them to the seventh
rank, pile up on a backward pawn,
create a protected passed pawn
and queen it... Many a game has


been won just that automatically:


"By means of simple/logical/ob-
vious moves, White converts his
advantage into a win"; "White's


[106]


attack plays itself" — we have
all read such formulas more than
once. However, today's high level
of defensive technique makes it
difficult to believe that a game
will, like a good horse, bring
its player to the desired end by
itself. When one plays an exper-
jienced master, who knows all of
the defensive tricks, sometimes
the road to victory is a narrow
path of precise moves.


Gligoric should have converted
his accumulated advantages into
a direct attack, beginning with
18 ¢4, kicking back the unfortu-
nate bishop before anything else;
after 18.. Bg6 19 £4 would have
been considerably stronger. The
threat of 20 £5 would have forced
19.. £6; then there would follow
20 £5 Bf7 21 Ng3, intending 22 Qf3
and 23 h4, etc. This would lead
to a sharp game, admittedly with
some risk to White, whose king
would not be left all that well
protected; but certainly he would
also have been left with most of
the chances. The halfhearted plan
White actually selects sends his
game down a blind alley.

18. £2-£4 Bh5:e2

At last, this bishop goes from
words to action, removing the last
of White's knights.

Qd1:e2
Qe2-c4


After 18 £4, the plan of cre-
ating a passed a-pawn lost much
of its punch, since the ever-
present threat of ..ef prevents
White from devoting sufficient
attention to the queen's wing.
Here a combinative player would
certainly have permitted himself
20 g4, threatening 21 g5, 22 Qed,
and 23 £5; if then 20.. h621 h4
is quite possible, and the threat
to advance the g-pawn once again
forces Black's king to remain in
the center. Taking the h-pawn
would not be without risk for
Black either, in view of 22 fe,
opening up the center; in that
event, even Black's best move,
22.. 0-0, would leave him with a
difficult position. White wants
to improve the placement of his
pieces a bit before embarking
upon the pawn storm; but Kotov,
as usual, defends superbly.


20. Disc 0-0
21. Qch-c6 R£8-d8


White wanted to make a second
use of the same technique for

For the present, this bishop is

exchange of queens would give
both bishop and pawn a brilliant
future. Kotov, naturally, does
not take the queen.

Reculer pour mieux avancer. A

gets the chance to play .. ef,
forcing the trade of the dark-

nesses will be laid bare.

Boleslavsky repeats the line
Najdorf so successfully employed

Taimanov eschews 8 d5, attempt-
ing instead to gain the upper
hand by means of 8 Be3. However,
this move is so inoffensive as
to place White in the defender's
position. Further investigation
of this system has shown that
by playing 8.. Re8, Black can
practically force a whole series
of exchanges, thereby solving
his defensive problem (cf. Game
107, Reshevsky - Najdorf). When
this game was played, that im-
provement had not yet been dis-
covered. After 8.. Ng4 9 Bg5,
Black could play 9.. Bf6o, of-
fering to trade off the dark-
square bishops; after the move
he actually plays, White car-
ries out a plan which secures
him control of d5 and a defi-
nite advantage. So Black's
8.. Ng4 maneuver must be con-
sidered not wholly satisfactory,
inasmuch as he intends to con-
tinue with 9.. f6; the same
8.. Ng4 would be much better if
Black played it in conjunction

Nd5, and the rooks to dl and cl
or else to di and el. If he is
allowed to carry out all this,
sooner or later Black will be
forced to advance the c-pawn,
after which White can success-
fully assail the d-pawn.


Black's counterplay is based,
first and foremost, on his bi-
shop-pair, which enable one some-
times to hold a draw even ina
pawn-down endgame; and secondly,
on the shaky status of the e-
pawn, since its defender will
have to reckon with the pawn on

Let us watch now as the two
plans collide, and what comes
of it.

White's plan requires 16 Rfd1,
in order to threaten 17 Bd4, and
so as to be able to meet 16..Be6

A pretty tactical stroke: on
19.. ef 20 R:f3 R:f3 21 gf c6
22 Nc? Rb8&8 23 B:a7 snares the
rook; the same idea also works
in the variation 19.. a620 fg
R:f14+ 21 R:f1 c6 22 Nc7, etc.
And if 21.. B:g4 22 N:c7 Rc8,
Black is already a pawn down,
and still saddled with the
weakness at d6.


Black therefore hastens to
drive the knight out of d5 while
his rook is still protecting the
c7 square, White's dream of net-
ting the black queen's rook van-
ishes like smoke, and the move
19 £3 turns out to be useless.


It's almost sinful to criticize
a move that leads practically by
force to the win of a good pawn,
but it would appear that here,
too, White might well have held
to the positional course with
19 Rfdi, trading bishops on d4
and maintaining a powerful bind.

The opening is chiefly of int-
erest for its history. It saw a
lot of use in the Alekhine - Ca~
pablanca World Championship match,
where most of the games were drawn
after some positional sparring;
in any event, Black was unable to
win even one. Such biteless de-
fenses are out of fashion nowa-
days. White's next move was an
Alekhine invention, to which Ca-
pablanca's usual reply was
11.. N5f6. Stahlberg plays an
immediate 11.. e5, which fails
to ease Black's defense, but does
allow White to avoid the exchange
of queens he would have to permit
with 11.. N5£6 12 Ng3 Qb4+.

Naturally White is not tempted
by the win of a pawn: 12 de N:e5
13 B:d5 N:f3+ 14 gf cd 15 Q:d5,
since Black would then be able
to develop almost all of his re-
maining pieces with tempo on the
white queen. Nor would 12 B:d5cd
13 Nc3 amount to anything, in
view of 13.. e4, with a good game
for Black (14 N:d5? Qd6).

Here and later, Stahlberg holds
to his usual tactic (especially
when playing Black) of wholesale
exchanges, figuring that this will
secure him a draw sooner or later;
if any sort of concrete threat a-
rises, he trusts his experience
and tactical abilities to show
him a way out. However, if Stahl-
berg intended to trade queens, he
ought to have left himself the
bishop, since the white bishop
will be superior to the black
knight in any minor-piece ending—
though not sufficiently better to
forge a win from that factor al-
one, of course. Since the black
bishop will disappear in another
half-move, however, this was not
the time to trade queens. 16..Rad8
17 Rfd1 Rfe8 was natural: nothing
really threatens Black, and it is
quite likely that White would then
have tried for the trade of queens
himself by, for example, 18 Nf5
Qg5+ 19 Qg4, when Black could play
19.. Q:g4+, thereby returning the
g-pawn to its original file.

A curious picture. Black has
absolutely no intention of ever
playing .. g7-g6, even though
that would relieve him of many
of his later difficulties. In
the succeeding phase of the
game, Black saddles himself with
a number of weaknesses, advanc-
ing nearly every pawn but the
one he should have.


24. Rgl-g4


White has gradually accumu-
lated an uncommon store of posi-
tional capital: his king is cen-
tralized, his rook is on the
fourth rank, where it will at-
tack Black's pawns, the bishop
controls important squares, and
the knight is actively placed
too. As before, Stahlberg re-
lies on the inner defensive
strength of his position, and
on his ability to repel any dan-
ger by tactical means, while
Najdorf breaks down the black
position with a steady alterna-
tion of lefts and rights.

24. ave Nc8-e7

Nor should this exchange of
knights be counted an achieve-
ment for Black: his one remain-
ing knight cannot hope to pose
White any serious threats, while
two knights working together
might at least have driven the
white bishop from b3, thereby
easing the pressure on d5, which
grows more and more acute with
every exchange. So here too,
24,. g6 ought to have been
played.

26. Rg4-e4+ Ke7-£8
27. Re4-a4 a7-a6
28. Ra4-f4 £7-f6


It's amazing, how nearly right
Stahlberg's rather careless me-
thod of play is. This is appa-
rent from the fact that, despite
a string of inaccurate, and some
just plain bad, moves, Black's
game, positionally speaking, was
still not completely lost. True,
his choices were already lim-
ited: neither 28.. Rd7 nor
28.. Nd6 was any good, but af-
ter 28.. Nf6 he could still have
held things together. White
would have continued in the same
fashion, improving his position
with e4, f4-f5, then £4 a sec-


ond time, then a4, and then b4
after the bishop retreats, grad-
ually securing more and more
space. (An important peculiar-
ity of this position is that
after £4-f5 the square e5 is
not weakened, thanks to the
presence of a second f-pawn,
which prevents Black from es-
tablishing his knight on e5.)
But this plan would still have
met a lot of resistance from
his opponent; now, however,
28.. £67, this terrible and
completely unnecessary weaken-
ing of the e6 square, soon fol-
lowed by a second, 29.. h6
(which weakens g6), consider-
ably eases White's task.


29. Rf4-h4 h7-h6
30. Rh4-h5 ae

An excellent move! Having done
its work on the fourth rank, the
rook now goes to the fifth,
where it restricts Black's pawns
to complete passivity. White be-
gins to occupy more space by ad-
vancing pawns and bringing up
his king.

BLACK RESIGNED —

A loss of time. In such posi-
tions, it is better to focus
one's attention on piece devel-
opment, leaving the bishop to
fend for itself. If White pres-
ses to exchange it off on g6, I
believe this can only improve
Black's position.


6. 0-0 Bf£8-c5
7. Qdi-el! es


A fine move, which trains the
queen's fire on both black bi-
shops: now e2-e4 and b2-b4 are
both threats. White's system
of development is certainly not
as harmless as it might seem to
be (cf. the second-half game
Smyslov - Euwe).


7. ee 0-0
8. e2-e4 d5:e4
9. Nd2:e4 Nf6:e4


Black's last two moves seem
inconsistent to me. By his 10th
move, Black ought to have come
up with some sort of plan. The
first question to be decided is
whether he is going to retain
his queen's bishop or trade it
off. If it is to be traded, then
the bishop, not the knight, ought
to have taken on e4: it will now
be a long time before this bi-
shop can capture anything more
substantial than a pawn. And if
it is not to be traded (which,
to judge from Black's fifth move,
is indeed his intention), then
he ought to have retreated it to
h7 on the previous move, keeping
the pawn tension in the center
and restricting the mobility of
White's d- and e-pawns — and
even of his c-pawn — somewhat.
But if, after 9 N:e4, the dark-
square bishop were to retreat to
e7, then after 10 Nh4! Black
would still be forced to part
with one of his bishops, since
10.. Bh? would be impossible in
view of 11 N:f6+ and 12 B:b7.


10. d3:e4 Bf5=-h7
11. b2=b4 Bc5-e7
12. Bel-b2 Nb8-a6


Black's heedlessness has brought
him into difficulties, although
they are not yet insuperable. He
needs to develop his queen's
knight and to find a good spot
for the queen: a task best per-
formed by .. c6, .. Qc7 and..Nd7.
Bringing the knight to c7 looks
artificial, and it is difficult
even to guess what benefit Dr.
Euwe thought he would derive
therefrom.


13, a2-a3 c7-c6

15. c2-c4 Na6-c7

Now White has a clear advan-
tage. All six of Black's pieces
stand passively, and routine ex-
changes on the d-file will not
ease his situation, since the
fewer pieces remain on the board,
the more forcefully will the en-
tombed h7-bishop's absence from
the fray be felt. The choice of
the plan for the capitalization
of White's advantage is a matter
for individual taste; already,
more than one way is possible.
One good idea is 16 c5, followed
2 bringing the knight via c4 to


16. ke Be7-£6
17. N£3-e5 Rf8-d8
18. Bg2-£3 4:


White waits. 18 Qcl, followed
by c4-c5, was more active. Why
take over an open file, if one
is not going to use it to pene-
trate the enemy position? While
the d-file is under White's con-
trol, it ought to be used to get
the white knight to dé.


18, tere Nc7-e8
19, Rdi:d8 Qc8:d8
20. Rf1-d1 Qd8-c7
21. c4-c5 a7-a5


Black opens the a-file, and
abandons it forthwith: 23.. Rd8.
If that was what he intended,
then the a-pawn would have been
better left on a7, keeping the
possibility of playing .. b7=-b6.

White has not maneuvered very
energetically, and Black has suc~-
ceeded in improving the place-
ment of his pieces — without,
however, solving his biggest
headache: the bishop is as much
out of the picture as ever. This
makes White careless; he has
completely forgotten to look af-
ter his e-pawn, and here was
Black's chance to punish him.
Euwe could practically have
equalized by 27.. Qa8, threaten-
ing to invade via a2. So the
restrained 26 £3!, instead of
26 Bf1 and 27 £4, was the move
to keep the h7-bishop's horizons
limited.


One way to free the bishop
from its kingside incarcera~
tion would be .. £7-f6 and
.. e6-e5, allowing the bishop
to exit via g8. It is this plan
which Black intends to carry
out now, in fact, and White
must play actively in order to
keep the upper hand. The immed-
jate threat was 27.. Nd4, hit-
ting the queen at c2 and cut-
ting off the queen's bishop from
the knight on e5 — this ex-
plains White's last move. Now
Black could have brought about
a trade of queens with 27..Nd4
28 Qd1 Nb5, as the white queen
cannot simultaneously guard the
e-pawn and escape from the
knight. White would therefore
have continued 29 Q:d8+ B:d8,
keeping somewhat the better
ending: 30 Bd3 Kf£8 31 Kf2 £6
32 Nc4 Ke7 33 Ke3, and not
only does Black get no chance
to push his e-pawn, he must
now worry about whether White
will push his. So Black chooses
to fight with queens.

This is stronger, in my opin-
ion, than 9.. Be?7, as Szabo
played against Gligoric. Indeed,
there can't be very many opening
variations in which Black suc-
ceeds in developing all of his
minor pieces so quickly, to such
active positions!


From here on, the knight on e4
draws battle like a magnet. It ap-
pears firmly entrenched at present;
if it should chance to be driven
away, however, Black's entire game
will totter.

An interesting variation, in
which the knight is sacrificed at

moment, and then disappeared.
Botvinnik used it against Smys-
lov in the 1943 Moscow Champion-
ship, and a very lively game re-
sulted. Since then, however, no
one has come forward who has been
willing to repeat the experiment
in a game of any importance.

12 ef was also possible; in
that event, the recapture on f6
would have forced Black's knight
to leave its outpost at e4, when
White could have continued with
13 Nb3 Bb6é 14 Nbd4, or 14 Neg5,
leading to a game of lively piece
play. Averbakh, however, hopes to
get more out of the position by
retaining the pawn on e5 and
driving out the knight with f2-f3.
Then, too, 12.. N:f6 is not the
only move: 12.. N:f2 is still
possible.

15. Qdi:d4 is


Why not the natural 15 cd?
Thereby hangs a tale which we


shall now proceed to elucidate,


For many years — since Fleis-
sig - Mackenzie, Vienna 1882, to
be exact — 15 cd £4 16 £3 Ng3
was considered to be unequivo-
cally in Black's favor, since
after 17 fg hg, none could see
a way to prevent the black
queen from getting to h2. Cer-
tainly, passive defense allows
Black's attack to grow very
fierce in a very short time:
for example, 18 Be3 Qh4 19 Ret
Qh2+ 20 Kf1 Bh3.


Then Boleslavsky's painstak-
ing investigations forced are-
evaluation of the position. In
his well-known games with Bot-
vinnik and Ragozin, he showed
that the continuation 18 Qd3
B£5 19 Q:£5 R:f5 20 B:f5 ren-
ders the queen's sortie harm-
less, since after 20.. Qh4
21 Bh3 Q:d4+ 22 Kh1 Q:e5 23 Bd2,
White's pieces set up a combined
pressure against the black king
which occupies the queen suffi-
ciently to prevent it from sup-
porting the advance of Black's
pawns.


After that it was Black who
began to avoid this variation,
until the Moscow master Yakov
Estrin came forward to suggest
that Black play, instead of
23.. Q:b2 (Botvinnik) or 23..c5
(Ragozin), an immediate ..d5-d4-
d3. With his analyses, some of
them worked out to the thir-
tieth move, Estrin won a num-
ber of pretty games by corres~
pondence, achieving what, in
all probability, even he had
not expected: this chameleon-
variation began to be avoided
by both White and Black!


(A final note: it would be
naive to try to keep White's
queen from h7 with 18.. g6,
since the queen could still
reach h2 for defensive purposes
from h6é.)


That's a sketch of the rea-
sons why Averbakh recaptured on
d4& with the queen instead of
the pawn. That's how matters
stand today — how will they
appear tomorrow? For the present,


the search (White's, now) continues.


Some Czech players have been
analyzing 17 Rf2, instead of
capturing the knight. Knowing


Boleslavsky, I am sure he will
cross swords with Estrin's line
as well, sooner or later.


Let's get back to the game.

The piece sacrifice 17.. Ng3
would clearly have no point here
(18 hg fg 19 Qd3 BES 20 Q:£5 R:£5
21 B:£5 Oh4 22 Bh3, and Black
doesn't even have the queen check
at d4), which is why the whole
variation, up to and including
17.. Ng5, has been considered un-
favorable for Black. Szabo plays
the move theory has condemned any~
way, and since he shows that the
knight does not really stand so
badly on g5, he opens, if not a
new page, then at least a new
paragraph in the opening handbooks.

The a- and b-pawns have greeted,


[115]


and passed, one another, and
the game's culminating moment
has almost passed by umnoticed
as well. A natural thought was
19 cb cb 20 Qd4; but on 19 cb
there comes 19..c4 20 Qd4 Bf5,
and the defenseless f-pawn can-
not be taken safely by either
queen or bishop, while the at-
tempt to pick off the d-pawn
also ends badly for White. Here
are the variations:


a) 21 B:£5 R:f5 22 B:f4 Ne6,


b) 21 Q:£4 Nh3+ 22 gh B:c2, and
the white king's position is
unsafe,


c) 21 B:f£5 R:£5 22 Rd1 Ne6

23 Q:d5 Qb6+ 24 Khi Rd8, and
Black wins, thanks to his pawn
on c4, which prevents White from
getting his queen back to b3.


Averbakh saw through Szabo's
elegant combination; not want-
ing the knight on é€6, however,
he invited Black to sacrifice
it, although this exposed him
to some degree of risk.

ROUND ELEVEN


71. Euwe—Averbakh
(Nimzoindian Defense)


Even with the middlegame at
full boil, a master must al-
ways be thinking about the
endgame. The outcome of many
games, even some in which the
king barely escaped direct
threats and a seemingly inev-
itable catastrophe, has only
been decided deep in the end-
game. This game was typical
from that standpoint, but a
rarity nonetheless. Averbakh
chose a plan leading to the
creation of a queenside passed
pawn. Knowing that a passed
pawn generally increases in
value as the number of pieces
decreases, Averbakh resigned
himself to the temporary dis-
comforts of Euwe's frontal as-
sault, concluding the game
with an elegant knight sac-
rifice in precisely the sec-
tor where the passed b-pawn
had been awaiting its hour.

By developing his bishop to
the long diagonal, White pro-
voked 12.. c4. This makes his
intended push of the e-pawn
much stronger, since that pawn
would no longer need to guard
d4. Averbakh is willing to
meet him halfway, since he in-
tends a rapid advance of his
queenside pawn majority.

This practically guarantees
Averbakh an advantage in any


[117]


sort of endgame. Euwe's planis
certainly unusual, to say the
least. The problem is not so
much the bishop's retreat tobl,
since it remains on the attack-
ing diagonal, but that on the
previous move he could have
played his rook to cl. However,
Euwe thought that Black would
be unable to keep the rook im-
prisoned at al, so he was un-
willing to waste the tempo re-
quired to move it.

The reserve rook now speeds

Beautiful sacrifices are not
the only moves which deserve
exclamation marks; such marks
should also be placed after
moves which are major links
in a consistent strategic plan.
The tactical justification of
26.. Qd8 is that it would be
dangerous for White to avoid
the trade, as this would allow
Black's queen a very profit-
able excursion to h4.

Euwe was roundly criticized
for this move, and later he
himself recommended 28 Re6; but
it is quite evident that he had
already formulated his plan of
going into a minor-piece end-
game and maneuvering the knight
via £4 and e6 to c5, followed
by the capture of the a-pawn.
After 28 Re6, however, the
rooks would also have been
traded off eventually, with
pretty much the same endgame
resulting.

Disappointed at the failure of
his original intention, to bring
his knight to e6, Euwe insists on
having it his way, and starts to
push pawns, in hopes of regaining
control of e6 and bringing the
knight there after all.


No two ways about it: White
does have a bad endgame. Howev-
er, for the moment the position
is of a closed nature, and Black
must search for a spot to break
through. White should play his
knight to d2 or bi, and leave
his g-pawn at g3. By starting
now, White could get this plan
carried out just as Black gets
set up for the queenside break-
through: 32 N£4 Kf7 (otherwise

The first step towards dis-
aster. Having exchanged off his
darksquare bishop, White should
have redoubled his concern for
the vital d4 square; instead,
he weakens it — strange as that
may sound — with 13 a3, which
gives the black knight a bridge
to transfer itself from c5 via
b3 to d4&. But that's still only
half a problem.

The second step, and the fatal
one. Although the commentators
called this an unbelievable ov-
ersight, it may be understood
as the conclusion to the plan
begun with his 11th move. In
fact, were it not for the pawn
White will lose after the ex-
change of bishops, he wouldn't
have all that bad a position —
but that “were it not" spoils


everything.

With his ship all fitted out
for a long voyage, White unex-
pectedly heads for a quiet back-
water. A contemporary opening
does permit this sort of treat-
ment, however: White seeks a
small but secure advantage from
his control of the d5 square.
Now we shall see a curious pro-~
cession: knight, pawn, bishop,
and finally the second knight,
all pass through this same
square, to be coolly removed
by Najdorf. An endgame results
in which White still has hopes
for an advantage, based on his
more active bishop, but these
hopes go unrealized.


How is it that Boleslavsky,
who relishes a complex game,
could have chosen such a biteless
line? Presumably, since he plays
the Black side of the King's In-
dian so frequently himself, he
was unwilling to divulge his own
views on the White side of one
of the major variations.


Soon after the position had
simplified, Najdorf, who was
not at all averse to a draw,
asked his opponent:


"Did you play that move for a
draw?"


"No. "


"Does that mean you played it to
win?"


"Mmm ... Partly."


"Maybe you played it to lose?!"


"T played the move which met
the needs of the position."


While I will not swear to the
literal accuracy of the entire
dialogue, I would like to draw
the reader's attention to this
last retort, which so typifies
Boleslavsky's thinking.

The idea of using b2-b4 as

ers much reduced.

such is the mistake Taimanov
makes here. For the moment, the
chances are about even. It would
be hard to single out any spec-
ific White advantage, but, in
any event, Black has none. Black


will spend the rest of the game
trying to drum up counterplay on
the queenside — against what?
Soon, White will move out his en-
tire herd of pieces from the area
to the left and below the diagonal
pawn-chains; then, after the ex-
change of rooks (which Black ini-
tiates), the question of who con-
trols these squares will cease to
be of any importance whatever. If
Black does not exchange rooks,
however, White will seize the e-


file.

which is: to remove every single
one of his pieces from the queen-
side, and set up an attack on
the king, making use of the numer-

due to the absence from that sec-

he undertakes the decisive action

this technique fails him in this
instance is that there he will
find absolutely nothing and no

King's Indian's fierce foe. Sur-
rounded by his g2-f3-e4-d5-c4
palisade, White calmly develops
his pieces on the squares left
open, while Black is unable even
to dream of breaking in the cen-
ter, and must place all his hopes
in a wing attack. Here too, how-
ever, life is no bowl of cherries,
since White's king, which is the
chief target of his assault, will


be spirited away to the queen-
side, robbing Black's pawn press
..£7-f£5-f4 of much of its ef-
fect by rendering it largely
pointless.


Meanwhile, White has a wider
choice of strategic plans. With
the center closed, he may at-
tack on the kingside with g4,
h4 and h4-h5 etc., or try for
a queenside break by leading
away from his own king with a
pawn attack. Before deciding on
an active plan, both White and
Black engage in a lengthy war
of maneuver, of the sort that
occurs in many contemporary
grandmaster games. Generally
speaking, the ideas behind such
play are: to find the best pos-
sible positions for one's pieces,
to restrict the opponent's ini-
tiative, to trade off one's own
"bad" bishop for the enemy's
“sood" one, and finally, to pre-
pare a break. In the present
game, for example, up until the
42nd move only one piece and
one pawn had been exchanged. At
that moment, however, the game
entered its combinative phase,
and the reader who has followed
the phase preceding that with
diligent attention will be rich-
ly rewarded for his pains. He
will see sacrifices, counter-
sacrifices, feints and kingside
attacks — in a word, all the
trappings of a lively game.

This is not the only plan for
Black. He might also play 7..c6,
attempting to undermine the cen-
ter, or 7.. a5, to bring a knight
to c5; but as Makogonov showed
in his day, White's attack on
the kingside moves very swiftly.
If Black prepares ..f£5 by drop-
ping his knight back to e8, then
8 g4 sometimes follows, giving
White the opportunity to open
the g-file for his rooks with
a later g4:f5.


Black's choice in this game is
the end product of a battle of
ideas of many years! duration.
From h5, the knight mechanical-
ly prevents h4-h5, which conse-
quently renders the push h2-h4
at least temporarily useless;
and on 8 g4, then knight goes


[123]


to £4, halting White's attack.
7.. Nh5 also prepares 8.. f5:
all logical enough, but no more
than that.


8. Qdi-d2

Black closes the game in the
only sector where he had any
chance to stir up some activity
for his pieces — why? The answer
comes from Gligoric's next two
moves, but it's hardly a satis-
factory one. Black wants to trade
off the darksquare bishops with
..Bg7-f6-h4, but he is unable to
achieve this. It is possible that
on 9.. Nbd7 or 9.. Qe8, as Geller
himself usually plays for Black,
Gligoric was afraid of 10 ef gf
11 24; in that event, he should
continue 11.. fg 12 fg Nf4. White
may get open diagonals, but they
will not be easily occupied, and
Black will get his chances too.
He who plays the King's Indian
must be prepared for dangerous
variations. With his 9.. £4, Black
resigns himself to having less
say in the game.


10. Be3-f2 Bg7-£6
11. Ngi-e2 Bf6-h4
12. Bf2-g1 te


With a pawn chain entirely on
light squares, Geller naturally
does not intend to be deprived
of his darksquare bishop. True,
the rook is shut in, but it takes
two black pieces (the knight on
h5 and the bishop on h4) to keep
it in. (Note that 11.. Bh4 is
made possible by the combination
12 g3 fg 13 hg R:£3).

Gligoric considers his posi-
tion strong enough to withstand
a siege, but against passive play
by Black, sooner or later White
will find a way to break through.
16.. c5 was worth a thought here,
in order to hem in the bishop on
gl and perhaps give his own bi-
shop an exit via d8. White would
most likely have taken en passant,
leading to a livelier game.

White wanted to carry out the

but Gligoric does not allow it.

The threat of 22 c5 forces
Black to retreat his rook to
£8, and on the following move
to play 22.. b6é. Having already
passed up the chance to enliven
his game, Black must now wait
and watch as White improves his
position and prepares his break.
Now Black's chances lie inwhat-
ever accidental tactical shots
may happen to present themselves.

26. Rci-gi eae


The onslaught White now sets
in motion is not so much aggres-
sive as prophylactic in nature.
Before breaking on the queen-
side, White wants to secure the
king's wing, fearing that once
all of his pieces have left that
sector, Gligoric will find a
favorable opportunity to play
+g 6-25-84. But now the base of
White's pawn chain is weakened,
giving Black the opportunity
for a break by means of a piece
sacrifice.

34. Qd3-di Nh7-£6
35. Be2-a4 b6-b5


Black cannot allow this bi-
shop to get to c6, and so he
is forced to play this active
move, resulting in the first
exchange of pawns and the open-
ing of the c-file for White.
White can no longer play his


[124]


break at c5, but that's not nec-
essary any longer, since its pur-
pose — to open an attacking

line — has already been attained
by other means; so he turns to an
attack on the c- and b-pawns. The
former will be hard to get, since
it is easily defended by minor
pieces; the latter must be iso-
lated from the bishop at d7, for
which purpose the maneuver Ne2-
ci-d3-b4-c6 will be useful — but
that will mean pulling White's
last piece away from the king's
wing ..-.

Unexpectedly wrecking White's
maneuvering game. Sacrifices such
as this one are always in the air
around immobile pawn chains. Not
just the pawns, but the pieces be-
hind them also become much more
active, and White must go on the
defensive for a time.

Geller prefers to give up the

opponent to get three connected

How pitiful Black's pieces ap-
peared, cooped up in the narrow
space behind their pawn chain;
and how his whole position be-
gins to sparkle, once his pawns
are set in motion! If Black suc-
ceeds in picking up that last
center pawn, then of course
White would no longer be able
to hold the game; otherwise,
alas, it is still Gligoric who
must strive for the draw.

With all of Black's resource-
fulness, the position is still
uncertain. Geller has held on
to his extra piece and his cen-
ter pawn too; if he can get his
knight to d5, then Black must
perish. If Black can get in
.. 45, obtaining three connected
passed pawns, then the battle
will flare anew. White's last
move aims at seizing control of
d5, but it gives Black a sec-
ond chance. On the other hand,
51 Q£3 would allow Black the
possibility 51.. Qd7 and 52..g4.

If Black wants indisputable
equality against the Reti, then
the setup with ..c7-c6 and deve-
loping the bishop to f5 seems
best to me, following the clas-
sic example Reti - Lasker. There
have, of course, been cases in
which ‘the bishop ended up out of
action on the diagonal bi-h7, but
only because Black played in ster-
eotyped fashion, without consid-
ering circumstances.

After long thought, Black de-
cided to castle and do without
.. h6 for the time being. Some-
one once said — and many now
believe — that loss of time is
meaningless in closed positions.
If this is true, then it is true
only for thoroughly closed posi-
tions, not for the kind that now
exists upon this board. It seems
to me that 8.. h6 would have been
an unnecessary waste of time here.


9. N£3-h4


Smyslov reacts immediately to
Black's "inaccuracy", intending
first to trade off the bishop at
g6, then to play c4:d5, and then
to prepare e2-e4, in order to
clear the center of pawns and se-
cure great activity for his pieces.

A small subterfuge: Black con-
ceals his aggressive intentions
behind the mask of forced play.

Either White has underrated his


opponent's ideas, or he is sim-
ply being careless: Black's
long think after 8 Nc3 ought to
have forewarned him.


Smyslov probably thought that
Black was just putting on a
show of intending to sacrifice
a piece; and in fact, after
11.. B:g4 12 hg N:g4 13 Nf3,
Black would have no threats
whatever. A little zwischenzug,
however, alters the position
substantially.


It should be mentioned that
Black had just such a turn of
events in mind when he pondered
his eighth move, keeping in
mind that 11.. Bg6 12 N:g6 hg
13 d4 would have left White
with a definite advantage.

11. ace d5-d4

Taking the bishop would not

is an immediate threat.

Naturally, I could not calcu-

White mistakenly allowed atac-
tical shot which could have de-
cided the game at once: 14..Ba3,
and if 15 Q:g4, Black recovers
his piece, coming out two pawns
to the good. On 15 B:a3, Black
would get a third pawn with a
strengthened attack: 15.. Q:h4
16 Ret Q:f2+ 17 Khi Qh4+ 18 Kgl,
and now the quiet 18..c5 is pos-
sible, as are the more energetic
18..f£5 or 18..Nde5.


In this variation, Black must
play for some little time a rook
down, which to me seemed exces~
sive. Afraid perhaps of nothing
more than having to end this game
with a perpetual check, I decided
to comfort myself by taking a
third pawn for the piece. Evi-
dently, this was an inaccurate
assessment of the position.

Here the game was adjourned,
and White offered a


DRAW


the next day. I saw no way of
improving the position of my
pieces substantially; for that
matter, I had practically agreed
to the draw with my 30th move.
White needed only the check on
c4 for a three-time repetition,
and so I took Smyslov's offer.


Imagine my surprise upon dis-
covering that the sealed move
had been 41 Ral-gi: once again
Smyslov had declined the draw!
It seems to me, however, that
this move would have given
Black good winning chances

once again after 41..Qg6: then
Black could answer the check

by moving his king to h7, fol-
lowed by either ..g5-g4 or
..h5-h4. Now White's pieces
would remain tied up by Black's
pawns; and if White were to car-
ry out the threat implicit in
his 41 Rgi, which is: to sacrifice
the exchange back with 42 R:g3
fg+ 43 R:g3, Black could keep
the initiative by means of the
continuation 43.. h4 44 Rh3 Rf4,
with strong pressure on the e-
and f-files. Smyslov and his
second Simagin, however, thought
that the immediate 41..h4 42 Ne4,
etc. was forced for Black, and
it's hard to say which of the
two of us was right. When a
game is adjourned in a complex
position, usually each side un-
consciously evaluates the po-
sition in his own favor.


What conclusions can be drawn
from this tense and interesting
struggle? First: even in the
most important games, one may,
if conditions are right, employ
a sacrifice which cannot be ana-
lyzed in detail; second: if a
mistake or an inaccuracy occurs,
there is no need to assume “all
is lost" and mope — one must
reorient oneself quickly, and
find a new plan to fit the new
situation.

77. Keres—Reshevsky

(Nimzoindian Defense)
the reader should ask which
I liked the best of all in
tournament, I would have to
over my own two encounters
with onetime American wunderkind
Samuel Reshevsky in favor of one
of the tournament's most note-
worthy games from the viewpoint
of its depth of conception, beau-
ty and complexity. This game has
been reproduced in chess journals
in every language, and has been
subjected to dissection by doz-
ens of masters, almost all of the
grandmasters, and even Botvin-
nik himself — and yet we still
cannot say with absolute certain-

ty that these analyses represent
the final answer. The reader will
have the opportunity to examine
for himself, and perhaps to add
his own contribution to the col-
lective effort of all the world's
chessplayers.

Here 7..Nc6 is usually played;

of position is reached which is
well-known from the games Bot-
vinnik - Reshevsky (Moscow 1948),
Bronstein - Najdorf (Budapest
1950), and Geller - Smyslov, from
this tournament. Reshevsky re-
peats the opening he played a-
gainst Euwe, but where White was
unable to summon the courage to
play 8 e4 in that game, Keres
does so here.

R.G. Ashurov, a Class-A player
from Baku, has pointed out a dif-
ferent possibility for White
here: 9 e5, and if 9..B:g2, then
10 Bg5 Bshi 11 ef g6 12 B:g6! hg
13 Qg4 with a very strong attack,
which Ashurov carries out to mate
in several lines. True, some of
these variations could be improved
for Black, but without a doubt
he gets into serious trouble if
he takes the pawn and the rook.
His best reply to 9 e5 would be
to retreat the knight, when White
could maintain the pressure with
10 Qh5.

Fierce! 9..d6 was also possible:
if 10 e5 de 11 de, then Black
would not play 11..B:g2, which
would lead to a complete collapse
of his game in very short order,
but 11..Be4! On 9..d6, White
would probably have continued
10 £4 Nbd7 11 N£3 cd 12 cd, with
a much more active position; so
Black prefers to force matters.

It's easy to see that if Black


were to take the bishop here, he
would have to return it at once,
since 10..hg 11 hg N:e4? 12 Qh5

The best chance to defend his
difficult position. In such sit-
uations, many players are ready
to throw up their hands and play
the first move that comes to
mind; but Reshevsky does not de-
spair.


White has several means of
destroying the black king's pawn
cover. Here Keres concocted an
astounding combination, whose
main variation runs roughly as
follows: 15 B:£6 gf 16 Qg4+ Kh8


[129]


17 Q£3 Nd7 18 0-0-0 Nre5 19Q:f6+

22 NgSt! Kg8 23 Q:h6 £5 24 Nieb
Qh7 25 Q:h7+ K:h7 26 N:£8+ R:£8
27 R:d6 — and the rook ending
will pose few problems for White.


There are certainly many other
possibilities for both sides a-
long the way, which no one could
possibly have calculated; but the
extended conception of unusual
beauty is a hallmark of Keres'
talent.


And now the reader who would
like to poke about with us through
the byways of these combinations
should follow the analysis, as
Nimzovich once recommended, on
two chessboards: one to make the
moves of the game, and the other
to examine the variations.


15. Bg5:£6 628


15 ef hg 16 hg is also quite
good enough here — Najdorf, in
fact, considered it “interesting,
and probably the winning line"—
16..Qe5+ 17 K£1 Q:g5 18 fg Rc8
19 Re3 Q£4 20 Rh3 Q:c4t+ 21 Ne2

Nedeljkovic and Vukovic put
forward 19 Qf£3 Nc6 20 Qh3 in
this line, as well as the alter-
natives:

Q:c4+ 19 Ne2 e5 20 Qd6 Qeb
21 Qd3 e4 22 Qg3 gf 23 Qh4.


Vv. Turchuk has rightly up-
braided me for uncritically ac-
cepting this analysis, pointing
out that, instead of 21 Qd3,
White could give mate in three
by 21 Rh8+, 30 Q:f£8+, and 23 Q:g7.
After that, I critically re-exam-
ined the variation, and came up
with 21 Q:f8+! K:£8 22 Rh8 —
mate again, and in one move less!


Euwe also thinks that the
knight ought to have been taken
with the pawn, but that after
15,.hg the proper continuation
is not 16 hg (as Najdorf would
have it), but 16 fg: for example,


a) 16..K:g7 17 QhS gh 18 Q:h4,
with the threat of 19 Rg3+;


b) 16..Qe5+ 17 Re3 Q:g7 18Rg3
f6 19 Nf3, threatening 20 N:g5.


As we can see, all of the com-
mentators agree that this con-
tinuation (15 ef) was clearer,
and would have led to a quicker
win. There were indeed two ways
to win, but the line White ac-
tually chose was no less forcing
and no less beautiful than those
that were suggested post mortem.
Obviously, once Keres had come
up with a plan that was good en-
ough to win, he carried it out
without distracting himself by
calculating new complexities.

Such a combination, however, is
not easily calculated over the

Trifunovic, and Reshevsky him-

opinion), 18 Rd6. Indeed, White
wins after both 18..fe 19 0-0-0

but the defense 18..Kg7, threat-

Reshevsky could have given up

more exact; then after the trade
of the queen for two rooks White
could continue 23 £3, followed


by 24 g4 and 25 Nf4, with an
undiminished attack, in spite
of the attenuated material.
Once Reshevsky took the rook
with his knight, Keres could
finally enter the concluding

2. Nbi-c3 g/~g6
3. g2-g3 Bf8-g7
4. d2-d3 Nb8=-c6
5. Bfi-g2 Ra8-b8


Maybe a little bit too straight-
forward — an opinion Black soon
comes to share himself. On b8
the rook supports the onrush of
the b-pawn, which is the sort of
forceful assault that makes sense
only when conducted in the neigh-
borhood of the white king. Inthe
present game, however, White se-
cures his king in the right-hand
corner.


6. £2-£4 d7-d6
7. Negi-f3 e7-e6
8. 0-0 Ng8-e7


General considerations impelled
White to push his e-pawn to e5,
without worrying about its loss,
since this opens at least three
lines: White's half of the e-file,
the ci-h6 diagonal, and the g2-
c6 diagonal. In addition, the
excellent post at e4 is cleared
for White's queen's knight.


9. e4-e5 d6:e5


Naturally, Black could also
have continued with 9..d5, main-
taining a closed position where
his lag in development would not
have been so important — that's
probably how he should have
played it,


10,


£4:e5


Nce6:e5





[133]


11. Bci-f4 Ne5:£3+

The knight seizes its chance
to escape with check. Attempting
to maintain it on e5 would only
mean more trouble for the king,
for example:


I. 11..f£6 12 Bse5 fe 13 Ng5;


II. 11..N7c6 12 N:e5 N:e513 Qe2;
III. 11..0-0 12 N:e5 Qd4+ 13 Khi
B:e5 14 Nb5 Q:b2 15 Rbi.
12. Qdi:f3 Rb8-a8

Hitting the bishop with 12..e5
would have been useless, since
that piece is aching for achance
to leave the f-file anyway, and
taking a pawn en route makes it
even better. The bishop also
would not be averse to leaving
£4 for e5 now, after the rook's
return to a8; but in that event
Black could castle, thereby exer-
cising his right to "make three
moves in one".(We have grown so
used to castling that we think
of it as just another move, when
in fact it is not: the rookmoves
from h8 to £8, defending f7, while
the king leaps from e8 to g8, de-
fending the bishop at g7.)


13. Bf4-e3 eee


White is not above taking the


c-pawn. 13 Bc7 would be a mis-
take, in view of 13..B or Qd4+.
13. ae 0-0
14. Be3:c5 Bg7-d4+


Symptomatic: in this type of
position, White usually spends
considerable effort in order to
enforce an exchange of dark~
square bishops, so that the im-
portant squares f6 and h6, so
close to Black's king, may be
the more easily occupied by
White's pieces. The fact that
it is Black who initiates the
trade of bishops here shows that
he is by now unable to think in
terms of principles, but only of
how to reduce the number of at-
tacking pieces, which nearly al-
ways benefits the defender.


Bc5:d4
Kgi-h1


15.

Qd8:d4+
Ra8-b8


As long as White has not yet
come up with any concrete threats


to mate or to win material,
Black should strive to develop
his queen's bishop as quickly
as possible — that's the idea
behind this rook move (..b6

and ..Bb7). Time, however, is
an expensive commodity in chess.
On b8 the rook is unprotected
once again, and soon comes un-
der fire from the queen.


Good or bad, he ought to have
played either 16..Nc6 or an im-
mediate 16..e5.


17,


Nc3-e4












The knight cannot be kept away
from £6. At e4, it simultaneously
masks the f4 square, through
which the white queen intends to
slip into h6; with the queen at
h6, Ne4-f6+ would be fatal for
Black, so he hits at the knight
immediately. Once again, Keres
is playing concretely, with hard-
ly a thought for the weak pawn,
subject to frontal assault, that
he gets on e6,


17. ae £7-£5
18. Qf3-£4 Bc 8-d7
Black's move may be understood
in terms of the proverb,"’Better
late than never". In this case,
however, never would have been


better.


The only chance to continue
fighting lay in 18..Ra8, strange
as that might sound. Black would
have had serious difficulties, of
course, but there seems to be
no forced win for White. One
could hardly imagine such a game,


-{134]


where the black rook swings like
a pendulum from a8 to b8 and
back, and yet even then Black is
still able to maintain the bal-
ance somehow.

All Black needs now is one small
thing — his turn to move.

19. c2-c3

Giving the queen its choice of
moving forward, left or right. By
going forward to d3, Black risks

osing a piece after 20 Nc5 Qb5
21 Qd6; by retreating leftward,
to the kingside, Black would al-
low the knight to get to c53 so
therefore, the queen retreats
rightward, to the queenside, re-
taining control of c5 and d6. But
now the wolf comes in through a
different door — and once again,
the queen's rook is the culprit.


19. Sete d4-b6
20. Ne4-f6+ Rf£8:f6

The importunate knight must be
removed regardless of the cost,
since otherwise it not only cap-
tures the bishop on d7, but also
forks all three of Black's heavy
pieces (20..Kg7? 21 N:d7!).

Is it possible that this harm-

course.

14. Rdi:d6 Nc6-e7
15. Nf3-e5 ‘ee


This looks aggressive, but it
turns out to be a blunder that
costs a pawn. Even blunders, how-
ever, have their reasons some~-
times. For this encounter, Gli-
goric chose a cautious opening,
in which it is usually difficult
to secure an advantage; he also
went in for early simplifications,
resulting in a completely draw-
ish position. At that moment, sud-
denly, White began playing for a
win! The logic of chess does not
permit such things: once a posi-
tion of clear equilibrium has
been established, it takes more
than simple will-power to tip
the scales.


And it was not yet too late to
defend the c-pawn: 15 b3 Nf£5

20. b2-b3 were


There exists a widespread, and
therefore dangerous, misconcep-
tion that the win is automatic
once you are a pawn ahead. As a
matter of fact, Black's chief ad-
vantage in this position lies not
so much in his plus pawn, which
he is still far from exploiting,
as in his control of most of the
center squares: d4, d5, c5, £4
and f5.


White has his counterchances:
a queenside pawn majority and
the d-file. How many similar ;
games have been drawn because of
inexact play! Smyslov, however,
manages such endings with an iron
hand. His plan may be divided in-
to the following phases:


1. The immediate exchange of one
rook, leaving the other to re-
strain White's queenside pawns
and attack the c~- and e-pawns.


2. Deflecting White's rook to
the h-file by the threat to cre-
ate an outside passed pawn, and
then occupying the d-file with
his own rook.


3. Advancing the g-pawn to g4,
undermining the e-pawn's sup-
port, which is the f3-pawn.


4. Tying up White's pieces by
attacking the e-pawn.


5. Sending his king in to pick
off the weak pawns.


As we shall see, a simple win-


ning plan — for a Smyslov, nat-
urally!

80. Taimanov—Geller
(King’s Indian)

Perusal of this meaty game
will acquaint the reader with
two strategic ideas. As a result
of the opening Black obtains the
pawn configuration c5-d6-e5 ver-
sus c4-d5-e4; this ensures White
greater freedom to maneuver with-
in his own lines, since he has
three ranks, while Black has only
two. This is an abstract advan-
tage, of course, but it is the
master's task to render it con-
crete — that is, to find a plan
wherein this will prove useful.
It is instructive to watch as
Taimanov practically clears his
first three ranks of pawns en-
tirely, enabling him to trans-
fer his forces easily from one
wing to the other, while most of
Black's pieces find themselves
jostling one another on the sev-
enth rank, and especially onthe


eighth.


And the second idea: White doub-
les his rooks on the b-file, but
cannot turn this to account, since
all the good invasion squares are
covered by Black's minor pieces.
White therefore stirs up some
play on the other wing; harmless
in itself, this play leads to
the exchange of a few pieces and
draws the minor pieces away from
the b-file, thus allowing White's
rooks to invade at b7 and con-
clude the game within a fewmoves.

Geller's ninth move completed
his array; now he intends 10..ed,
with activization, so Taimanov
crosses him up by pushing his
center pawn.

10. d4-d5 oie's

Offering Black the choice of
trading on d5 or closing the
center — or doing neither. The
trade would make sense only if
White's bishop were on g2 and
Black's rook on £8. Maintaining
tension with 10..Qe7 andil..a5,
followed eventually by ..Nc5
and ..f7-f£5, looks good here.
As to Geller's choice, 10..c5,
that's a matter of chessic
taste: it seems to me that Black
has a harder time obtaining
counterplay in the King's In-
dian with a locked pawn config-
uration.

To complete this picture,
Black need only “follow through"
with ..Bh8. The position illus-
trates the meaning of the phrase,
"freedom of maneuver". A white
rook on b3 will control the b-
file and simultaneously defend
£3 and g3. In some variations,
the rook on bil goes to hi, and
the knight on di may go to c3,
e3 or £2; meanwhile, Black's
rooks and knights have only one


move apiece, Black's pieces can-
not use the b-file, nor can he
transfer pieces to the kingside.
However, Black's position is sol-
id enough: as we said, White
still has to prove his advantage.

Geller's exceptionally tough,

simply ..Re7, and the rook must
either retreat or trade, Now
White directs his knight, bi-

This move deserves its excla-

itself, but also as the finishing
touch to the game as a strategic
entity. All the moves which fol-
low are based on the quick trans-
fer of pieces from one wing to

queens promises fully equal

mind, Kotov should not have
been so eager to exchange

It is not clear whether Naj-
dorf was willing to take a draw
here, or simply wished to test
his opponent's intentions, but
in any event after 29..Rd8+ his
king would have had to retreat.
Of course, the draw would hardly
be forced, even after 30 Ke2
Rdc8; White could redeploy his
knights to e3 and b3, and try to
exploit his queenside preponder-
ance. However, Black would re-
tain powerful support points in
the center for his knights — all
in all, a stubborn fight would
lie ahead.


After 29 Kd3, however, the game
took an unexpected turn. Kotov,
full of optimism and fighting spi-
rit as usual, decided to pushhis
center pawns, drive off the white
king and secure d3. It is our op-
inion that this plan, even if it
could be fully carried out, would
not have been especially favor-
able to Black. However, pushing
the e-pawn does deprive the knight
on b6 of any chance to go to d5
after White's c4-c5. On e6, the
pawn performed an important func-
tion by protecting d5.

Before the play gets too live-

other ideas: he wants to carry
out the typical maneuver in this
opening — ..c5:d4 and ..d7-d5 —
at once.


Szabo probably figured that
Black could not play this be-
fore castling because of checks
on the a4-e8 diagonal; but Euwe
risked it anyway, and equalized.

Black needs ..c7-c5, which
White seeks to prevent by ap-

d-pawn, thereby forcing either

out the plan Black employs in
this game.


a aint d5:c4
6. Qb3:c4 0-0
7. e2-e4 Bc 8-g4


This, with the following moves,
is the Smyslov System of the
Grunfeld.

8. Bcel-e3 Nf£6-d7

This apparently illogical move
has its own logic and its own
history. When the system first
began to be played, 8..Nc6 was
usual here; 9 d5 would be ans-~-
wered by the bishop capture at
£3, for example: 10 de b5!, or
10 gf Ne5 11 Qe2 c6! Eventually,
White started to get the upper
hand in this; then Smyslov (and
others) began introducing re-
finements. This process of "lab-
oratory testing" resulted in
the move 8..Nfd7, which combines
two ideas: retaining the option
of ..c7-c5, and putting pressure
on the d-pawn. Now, for example,
9..Nb6 is threatened, and if the
queen leaves the d-pawn's pro-
tection, then 10..B:f£3 followed
by 11..B:d4.


There have been several tries
here: 9 Nd2, or 9 Be2 Nb6 10 Qd3
followed by long castling, which
leads to a double-edged game; or


9 e5, or 9 d5, or 9 Rdi Nb6 10 Qb3.


The conclusion was finally reached
that it is better to retreat the
queen to b3 before the knight
chases it away.


Szabo replies with an extremely
complicated variation involving
an immediate ..c/-c5.


9. Qc4=-b3 c7-c5


10, d4-d5


If the queen takes the b-pawn,
Black first trades his queen's
bishop for White's king's knight,
and then plays 1l..cd, abandon-
ing his queen's rook; one line
is 12 Q:a8 de 13 Q:a7 cb 14 Rbi
Nc6, and Black has a very strong
attack on the king for the ex-
change. The text makes it very
uncomfortable for the queen's
bishop, which now has the choice
of taking on £3 (which would
strengthen White's center) or of
remaining at its post, to face
great peril after 11 Nd2.


10. Pre Nb8-a6
11, Nf£3-d2 e7-e6


Black appears to be locking his
own bishop in an escape-proof
cell; this is not mere whimsy,
however, but the product of ana-
lysis which Szabo had already
tested in a game from a previous
tournament. For example: 12 h3ed
threatening 13..d4, and if 13 ed,
then 13..Bf5 14 g4 c4, clearing
c5 for the knight, which lets the
bishop retreat; if then 15 Q:c4
Ne5 is possible, and the bishop
is freed once again.























12. d5-d6


White's pawn has broken free
of its support, and will soon be
surrounded by the hostile army,
A fierce battle erupts around it,
but one may already predict that
the advantage must swing to Black,
whose pieces are all developed,
and who has already castled.


12. aes Bg7-d4


This move is justified by the
variation 13 h3 (winning the bi-
shop?!) 13..B:e3 14 fe Qh4 mate!
On the other hand, if White ex-
changes bishops himself and then
plays 14 Nb5, Black has the un-
pleasant reply 14..Ndc5, fol-
lowed by 15..e5. Black's passed
pawn on the d-file would be de-
fended, and therefore a great
deal stronger than White s; the
black pieces would also be better
placed.

13. Bfl:a6 aoe

This secures c4 for his knight
and wins a tempo for castling, but
it also opens the b-file.

Stahlberg's characteristically
negligent attitude towards the
safety of his king. An outstand-
ing tactician who knows how to
put up a staunch defense, he has
saved so many difficult positions
that he sometimes simply ignores
such weakenings as this. But his
g2-g3 will soon be followed by
f2-£3, and a cold wind will be-
gin to blow along the second rank,
now open from c- to h-file, which
will prove most unhealthy for
White's king.


Had White played 18 Rael here,
or 18 Ne7+ followed by 19 Rael,
his game would still have been
far from lost; now it gets very
difficult.

wanted to force this bishop to
exchange itself for his queen's
knight, he could have played
11 a3; this would have given
him much the better game, con-
sidering that he could then en-
force c3-c4, with powerful pres-

WY,
Vi





























Black is ready to play the
final move to consolidate his
position; but now comes anun-
expected blow, bringing the


[144]


combinative element into the game
and completely altering the sit-
uation. The e~pawn travels from
the third rank to the fifth, and
brings about a series of favorable
simplifications.


16. e3-e4 aces


When one's opponent is well
developed, such moves generally
are not even considered, since
the d4-pawn is "irretrievably"
weakened, while Black — well,
what does he have to worry about,
since he has no weaknesses? In
our day, the concept of "weak-
ness" has altered to such an ex-
tent that not just pawn struc-
ture, but the poor placement of
just one piece can be a weak-
ness.

19 Nd3 Q:c2 20 Ric2 B:d2 21 R:d2,
reaching an ending similar to
the one that occurs in the game,
but with a much weaker c-pawn.
And on 16..de, the black queen
turns out to be badly placed. A
sample variation will indicate
White's advantage in the fast-
paced piece play that ensues:

It would seem more logical to
continue harrying the queen by
17 Bd3: for example, 17..B:c5
18 Q:c5, or 17..de 18 B:e4 BES
19 B:f£5, and after the trading
on £5 White wins the b-pawn.
That's probably what Boleslavsky
intended to play, too, until he
discovered that Black has the
excellent defense 17..Bf4; so
he changed his plan.

A very interesting position
has developed. White's natural
plan — the minority attack with
a4, b4 and b5 — allows Black
active counterplay if he exploits
White's weakness (the d-pawn),
and perhaps carries out the ma-
neuver ..b/7-b6 and ..c6-c5.

Black, in turn, will find it
profitable to maneuver his rook
to support the pawn advance

.£7-f£6. If he sticks to passive
tactics on both wings, then his


game is bound to become difficult.


At the moment, Black threatens
20. .Bge4, trading off the knight,
and thereby making it harder for
his opponent to defend the d-
pawn; this explains White's next
move.

20. Nf3-d2 a6-a5

Here Black ought to have struck
at the d-pawn first by 20..Nf5:
his ..a6-a5 would have had more
point. after 21 Nb3. White could
answer with 22 a4, but then
comes 22..Bd7, induc ing a new
White weakness}; if 22 Rd1 in-
stead, then 22.,a4 23 Nel g5!,
with such possibilities as

.£7-£6 or ..Nf5-g7-e6.


Averbakh's move prevents 21 b4,
followed by Nd2-b3-c5; but we
have seen how he could have
achieved the same end using far
more active means.

21. Re5-c3

This rook was only passing
through c5; now it gives place
to the knight.

Black's previous move didn't
pan out: he wanted to prepare

his rook, but now 22..f6 would
be met by 23 e6!, when the white
pawn is very strong. So Black re-
luctantly goes on the defensive.

It takes great skill indeed to
induce Averbakh, a well-known

pawns on the same color squares
as his bishop.

Black is very much opposed to
advancing his pawn to b5; so he
sends up a trial balloon, offer-
ing to let White take on £5 and
thereby leave himself with knight
versus a bad bishop. White, how-
ever, calmly retreats his knight
to £3, obtaining maximum results.
Thus, the a4-pawn draws the pawn
to b5 after it, like string from


a ball, and the co- -pawn must suf-
fer in turn.

White has finally gotten what
he was after: as soon as the
knight reaches c5, Black's game
will be nearly hopeless, since
White will have an extra king-
side pawn, practically speaking,
and must eventually convert it
into a win. Nevertheless, the
move played gives Averbakh a
problem-like save!

In his difficult position,
Averbakh finds a brilliant ma-
neuver to set up a drawn position.
If 43 ab, then 43..R:b3 44 R:c6
R:b2 45 Rce7+ K£8, and White can-
not win. Of 43 R:c6, of course,
there follows 43..ba or 43..a3!,
and suddenly it is Black who
wins.

43. a2-a3 Bf5-c2

The picture has suddenly al-
tered: the weak b-pawn has be-
come strong, and the "bad" bi-
shop now occupies a strong posi-~
tion. There would be no point for
White in taking the c-pawn: 44 R:c6
Rhc8 45 R:c8 R:c8 threatens
46..Rc4, and if White brings his
king up to defend with 46 Kf3,
then 46..Be4+ wins for Black. If
the king were at fl, let's say,
then White could get to e3 viae2
and win. Thus, the ability to
note and exploit the tiniest of
nuances sometimes decides the out-
come of a game.


The following maneuvers can
no longer alter the result. The
question arises: was the win ever
possible? And if so, when did
White let it slip?


On move 40, instead of Nd3,
40 Rc5! should have been played,
not allowing Black two tempi for
..b4 and ..Bf5; then, on 40..b4,
he could have replied 41 Ra5; or
if 40..Rhc8 41 Nd3, and now if
41..Bf£5 42 Nb4, or if 41..b4,
then 42 Ra5, threatening 43 Nc5.
It seems to me that Black, in
spite of all his resourcefulness,
would have been unable to save
the game then.

87. Kotov—Petrosian
(Old Indian Defense)


We should like to draw the
reader's attention to the d4-
pawn in this game: doubled, iso-
lated, and surrounded by enemy
pieces, still it showed an ex-
ceptional vitality. Such pawns
were nonexistent in the games of
Morphy, Steinitz, Lasker, Capa-


blanca or Alekhine: they made
their debut in contemporary

grandmaster games, further en-
riching the treasury of ideas.


Such pawns appear not only in
the King's Indian, but also in
the Sicilian Defense after 1 e4
c5 2 N£3 Nc6 3 d4 cd 4 N:d4 g6
5 c4 Be7 6 Be3 Nf6 7 Nc3 Ne4
8 Q:¢4 N:d4 9 Qdi e5! 10 Bd3 0-0
11 0-0 d6 12 Ne2 Be6 12 N:d4 ed, and
in some other openings as well.


The d-pawn's survivability de-
pends, first and foremost, upon
the fianchettoed king's bishop,
without which it would be a mere
passing fancy; and secondly,
upon how effectively Black ex-
ploits the open lines adjoining
the pawn. And, in fact, such
were the themes of the Kotov -
Petrosian game.

3. Nbi-c3 Nb8-d7
4. e2-e4 e7-e5
5. Ngi-f3 Bf8-e7
6. g2-23 ies


This is the proper strategy.
White begins with the idea that
a similar position — except for
White's c-pawn at c2 — could
arise in the Philidor; there,
the bishop would stand on c4,
where it plays a leading role in
the attack on the king. Here,
however, at e2 or d3 it would
only interfere with the rooks'
actions on the central files. On
g2, however, it has an excellent
future, since Black will have to
cede the d4 square to White even-
tually, and then the e-pawn will
become mobile.


6. et 0-0
7. Bfl-g2 c7-c6
8. 0-0 a7-a6
Oe b2-b3 aise


A rather patchwork idea. White
is apparently anticipating ..b7-b5
by overprotecting c4, but then he
brings his knight to d2 so that it
may recapture on c4; nor is fian-
chettoing the queen's bishop par-
ticularly favorable with aknight
on c3. 9 h3 ought to have been
played at once, securing e3 for
the bishop and thereby strength-
ening d4.

11 Qc2 and 12 Rad1 was more

11. ia B7-b5
12, N£3-d2 eae

Kotov never leaves a planhalf-
carried out, even when he begins
to suspect the plan he has cho-
sen may not have been very good.
Here he feels that after 12..ed
13 Q:d4 c5 would be bad for Black,
since it would leave White's
knight the d5 square in perpetu-
ity; meanwhile, White is preparing
an eventual f2-£4. However, Black
comes up with a deeply thought out
forcing maneuver, leading to the
seizure of the d4 square and the
appearance of the "hardy" pawn.


12. aes Bc8-b7


12..Qb6 was also possible here,
when White would appear to have
nothing better than 13 Ne2; but
then the question arises: wouldn't
the knights have been better de-
veloped to d2 and e2 in the first


place?
13. Kgi-hi rei


White wants to play f£2-f4, but
he can't do it right away inview
of 13 £42 ed 14 Q:d4 d5!, with
the threat of 15..Bc5. The king's
retreat does not prevent Black
from carrying out his intended
maneuver, so some sort of devel-
oping move, for instance 13 Rel,
was preferable here.


13. aoe e5:d4
14. Qd3:d4 c6-c5


( See diagram, next page )


Occupying d5 will be favorable
for White if he can secure his
knight there or if a trade of
minor pieces on that square
leaves him with a tangible ad-
vantage. In the present instance,
neither condition holds, so Pet-
rosian is therefore not afraid to
weaken d5. White's queen is forced
to beat a slow retreat back into
its own camp, with the black
knight in hot pursuit.

After the queen retreats to

Black uses combinative means
to secure a positional advan-
tage: his next move, 18..g6, is
an important link. Petrosian
had to see all this before play-

tion would have been quite du-
bious by this time.

White needs only to bring one
of his rooks to di in order to
win the d4-pawn, but Black has
set up such fierce pressure on
the c4- and e4-pawns that both
rooks are occupied defending
them. The plan to win the hardy
pawn is not working out, and
White's game is hanging by a
thread, but Kotov's coolheaded
defense stems the tide.

The hardy pawn defies all its
foes! Not a single piece can at-
tack it, since it takes all of
them put together to keep it block-
aded. Now it is White's game that
looks suspect (29..d5 is a threat),
but Kotov finds a courageous pawn
sacrifice...

feels impelled to speculate

Against this system, a fre-

Geller has prepared a plan to
occupy the light squares in
the center and on the king's
wing. By pushing his pawn to
£5, he has driven the bishop
to c4, where it will shortly
be traded off. Now he plays
11 a4 in order to restrict


Black's queenside play.

Najdorf is temperamentally un-

queenside pieces have been hemmed
in, he undertakes a kingside div-
ersion, aimed chiefly against the
possibility of g2-g4. In a later
game, he castled here and held
the balance — not because his
game was good, but rather thanks
to his tactical skill.

Najdorf confidently sacrifices
a pawn for a little initiative.
His position after the 18th move
would indeed have been promising,
had Geller taken the a-pawn; but
Geller finds a steadier solution
to the problem, as we shall see.
Denying himself the material, he
acquires a great positional ad-
vantage instead by a series of
fine moves. And although Najdorf
gave his 17..b5 an exclamation
mark, it is possible that 17..Qc6
was better.

This exchange is aimed at sub-
jugating the light squares, es-
pecially d5, since White removes
one of the pieces which could de-
fend that square. The next links
of his plan will be to bring the
rook from f2 to al, assail the a-
pawn with his heavy pieces, tie
down Black's rooks and queen to


its defense, and finally to


bring his knight on b3 to e3,


and then to d5.


The first part of this plan
takes until move 24, the sec-
ond part from move 35 to move
27, and the third part is con-
cluded with White's 31st move.

91. Reshevsky—Bronstein
(King’s Indian)

This game had some influence on
the placement of the leaders,
since I stood 1% points behind
Reshevsky, and a win for me would
decrease that gap to half apoint.
If Reshevsky, who was undefeated
so far, were to win, he would
catch up to Smyslov. Soit would
appear that a draw suited none
of us three. (All of these rum-
inations may be considered as
part of the pregame warmup.)


The opening was a well-known
King's Indian, with both sides
striving for the initiative. The
second phase (up to move 23) was
mostly maneuvering; by its close,
a black pawn had appeared on a3,
and a white one on e5. In the
following phase, White tried to
cash in his initiative in the
center and kingside for a mating
attack, inventing a remarkable
combination which sacrificed a
pawn, a rook, and the exchange —
which Black neutralized by ex-
changing off the enemy knight.

A series of exchanges followed,
which laid bare the deficiencies
of Reshevsky’s pawn-pushing.


Queens plus opposite-colored
bishops usually means a very
sharp fight. In the game's con-
cluding phase Black kept up his
mating attack until the very last
move, unwilling to trade queens
anywhere except at b2, whichwould
have been hopeless for White.


Even after all this, it still
seemed as though Black might not
get his win. He found it, howev-
er, by means of a joint maneuver
by queen, bishop and pawn that
left the white pieces in a state
of absolute zugzwang.

A key move, justifying Black's

It is very important that the
white knight be kept out of f6.
The e5-pawn could not have been
taken by the bishop, since White
would have replied 28 R:e5 and
then taken the rook on d8; but
now White must give serious con-

White offers the e5-pawn. I
was quite tempted to take it,
meeting the obvious knight check
by sacrificing my queen for rook,
knight and pawn. Black's pieces
would have acquired tremendous
scope, with good prospects for
the further strengthening of my
position.


However, Reshevsky had prepared
a diabolical combination in ans-
wer to the pawn capture:


32..Q:e5? 33 R:£5, and now:


a) 33..Q:£5 34 N£6+ B:f6 35 R:e8+
R:e8 36 Q:e8+ Kg/7 37 gf+


b) 33..gf 34 Nf6+ B:f6 35 gf!!
Q:e3 36 Qg2 — check and mate.


The beauty of this combination
lies in the second line, in which
White, already a rook down by move
35, captures, not the queen, but
the bishop with a pawn, creating
an irresistible threat of mate.

32. ose Bf5:e4

White's volley has missed its

Here Reshevsky offered another
draw — and this time, I believe
he meant it.


Black's position deserves the
nod: his a3-pawn is strong, the
white king is exposed, and the


black knight is better than the
bad white bishop.

Reshevsky thought a long time
before sealing, deciding finally
to give up the doomed pawn, in
hopes that the capture with the
queen would give him an oppo-
site-colored bishops endgame,
while the knight capture would
lead to perpetual check: 41..N:g5

and mate is threatened at gf.

Nonetheless, the check on
move 43 was useful for White:
it brought Black's king out to
e7, so that now Black's queen
may not move to £2 in view of
45 Qe2+, trading queens for a
clear draw.

Neither player can afford to

White takes on b2, then Black
needs only to create one more
passed pawn on the kingside to
win; while if Black takes on e2,
the most he will ever be able to
achieve will be the capture of
White's a-pawn. But this would
still not be enough to win for
him, since at that moment the
white king would turn up at c2,
incarcerating its colleague.

92. Gligoric—Reshevsky

The first twenty moves in this
game were right out of theory,
and the players added very lLit-
tle of their own to the handbook.
It might seem rather dull to the
reader, but it does liven up a
little when Gligoric offers his
queen for rook and bishop on the
29th move. Despite the fact that
the resulting balance of forces
would favor Black arithmetically,
Reshevsky declined this sacri-
fice.

3. Nbi-c3 d7-d5

Keres, who stands apart from
King's Indianophiles and Nimzo-
lovers alike, has secretly
prepared a system for this tour-
nament involving ..c7-c5 at a
very early stage of the Queen's
Gambit Declined, and employed it
successfully against Stahlberg
and Geller, and in the last
round against Najdorf as well,
in reply to 4 Nf£3.


5. e2-e3 acas


A practical game is no theo-
reticians' polemic. Taimanov
was undoubtedly aware that af-
ter 5 cd theory finds an advan-
tage for White in every varia-~
tion from "a" to the end of the
alphabet — and as a matter of
fact, he had won a game himself
using precisely that line against
Prins at Stockholm 1952. But as
Taimanov, who has studied the
5 cd variation extensively, also
knows, the last word has not been
said here either. So he chooses
another line.


Really, is it possible to
“prove” that 4..c5 is contrary
to the logic of chess with such
lines as these:


a) 5 cd cd 6 Q:d4 Be7 7 e4Nc6
8 Qe3 N:d5 9 ed B:g5 10 £4Nb4
11 0-0-0 Be7 12 de Qc7 13 ef+

b) 5 cd cd 6 Q:d4 Be7 7 e4Ncb

8 Qd2 Nse4 9 Nre4 ed 10B:e?7
Q:e7 11 Q:d5 0-0 12 £3 Nb4

13 Qg5 etc.


Note too that after 5 cd Black
may try the so-called Peruvian


Variation: 5..Qb6 6 B:f6 Q:b2
etc.


The most precise knowledge
of opening theory cannot guar-
antee one against over-the-
board surprises. Therefore, a
grandmaster will frequently
avoid the “best™ continuation
in favor of his own, whether
accepted by theory or not.


Ds ones c5:d4
6. e3:d4 Bf£8-e7

8. Raleci aus


Awaste of time. White is dal-
lying with the development of
his kingside pieces, although
the game is now semi-open, which
means that White must take care
to get his king secured. The
more natural move here was 8 Bd3.


8. Aan b7~b6!
9. Bfl-d3 Nb8-c6
10. 0-0 Nc6=b4
11. c4:d5! Stere


A positional snare. If Black
succumbs and takes the bishop —
11.. N:d3 12 Q:d3 ed — then 13 Ne5
gives White a clear advantage:
on e5 the knight is better than
either bishop. White could: have
laid a tactical snare as well:
11 Ne5, and if Black takes the
bishop, 12 Nc6 Qe7 13 N:e7+Q:e7
14 Q:d3 Ba6é 15 b3 would lead to
a lively game with about even
chances. The swindle appears if,
instead of 12..Qd7, Black tries
to snatch a pawn in passing with
12..N:b2 13 Qe2 Qd7 14 N:e/+
Q:e7 15 Q:b2 Baé. White would
not take the knight on move 15,
but a doubly defended pawn in-
stead: 15 N:d5, and Black's
position would collapse. Black
would have to settle for the
first variation: 11 Ne5 N:d3
12 Q:d3 Bb7, since an immediate
11..Bb7 12 Bb1 would leave White
good attacking prospects against
g/7 and h7.

Both a prophylactic and a
waiting move. Minor piece trades
impend: White wishes to induce
»-N:c3, so that he can recapture


[156]


with a pawn and thereby strength-
en his d-pawn; Black goes along
with this, since the whole pawn
constellation will not be any
stronger for it. There's no need
to hurry with this exchange, how-
ever, since it can just as well
be played after 16 a3.

The classic starting position
for an attack against the hang-
ing c- and d-pawns. White must
weigh concretely his opponent's
threats against his own means
for coping with them. In the
event White continues passively,
Black has several attacking op-
tions:


a) Ne6-a5-c4, blockading the
c-pawn and pressing on the a-
pawn;


b) rook maneuvers on the c-
and d-files;


c) undermining the d-pawn by
means of ..b6-b5, ..a/-a5, and
.-bd-b4,


Black's final plan will de-
pend quite a bit on White's
counterplay: whether he settles
into a bunker defense, or car-
ries the play to the center with
c3-c4 and d4-d5, or attacks the
black king.


Taimanov puts off the deci-
sion for a move while he opens
a vent for his king.


20. h2-h3 Re 8-c7
21. Rel-e4 See


A bold idea. Objectively, it
may be that 21 c4 was stronger,
but Taimanov does not feel he
could defend the hanging c- and
d-pawns against a Keres; so he
decides to base his defense on
the pawn at c3, simultaneously
preparing an attack on the
king's wing.


21. eat Nc6-a5
22. N£3-d2 scene


Of course it was more appeal-
ing to move the knight up: 22 Ne5,
but this would have cost the ex-
change.


ie beads Qb?-d5


Keres insists on inviting c3-
c4, since he now threatens to
invade at a2. Taimanov, however,
is not to be put off his plan,
even though by now c3-c4 has
become necessary.


23, Red-g4 eae

















White has found a vulnerable
spot in Black's fortress — g?.
Now he wants to attack it twice,
following the precepts of chess
pedagogy: rook first, queen af-
ter. He also threatens the pri-
mitive 24 R:g7+, 25 Qg3+ and
26 Q:c7, as well as 24 Ned.


Some idea of how dangerous
the situation could become for
Black, should he try to avoid
weakening his pawn structure,
might be gleaned from the var-


iation 23..Nc4 24 Ne4 Ne5 25 Qg3
N:g4 26 Q:c7 (the rook sacri-
fice on g?7 could boomerang on
White here: 25 R:g7+ Kig7 26 Qg3+
Ng6! 27 Q:c7 Q:e4! 28 Q:d8 NE4,
forcing mate).


23. Sea £7-£5
24, Rg4-g3 Rd8-c8


Black is not going to be able
to break in c3 without the use
of his pawns, so the rook move
is useless. 24..e5 would have
been the proper conclusion to
Black's strategy, torpedoing the
central d4-pawn. A careful exam-
ination of the variations pro-
ceeding from 25 Q:£5 ed will
convince us that all of them
wind up favoring Black. But now
the rook on g3 returns to the
e-file, fixing Black's newly-
created weakness on e6, and the
rook's sojourn from ei to e4 to
g4 to g3 to e3 is justified at
last.


25. Rg3-e3 Na5«c4


Black goes overboard in his
efforts to simplify and win by
means of pure technique. If
Keres wanted to continue play-
ing for the win, he had to test
White with either 25..Qd6 or
25..Qa2.


26. Nd2:c4 Re7:c4

27. baa Qd5-c6é


It's hard for Black to hold
his e-pawn, since White has,
besides a direct attack on the


pawn, the continual threat to
break with Re5 and d4-d5. Keres
decides to trade the e-pawn for
White's c-pawn, but he chooses
a bad moment to do it: better
to have played 27..R8c6 first,
and then to have retreated his
queen to d7, or even to dé.


For a more general evaluation
of such positions, the reader
should bear in mind that, were
Black's pawn at f7 instead of
£5, White would be in dire
straits after the maneuver ..b6-
b5, ..a7-a5 and ..b5-b4.


28. Rel-el Rc4:¢c3
29. Re3:e6 Qc6-c4
30. Qd2-£4 Rc3-cl


White's pieces are now very
active, and Black has a hard
time spotting all White's pos-
sible plans in time to neutra-
lize them. Here, for example,
31 Re8+ was threatened. So
Black first reduces the number
of pieces on the board.


31. Qf4:£5 Qc4:d4
32. Rel:cl Rc8:cl1+
33. Kgi-h2 ste


In a queen-and-heavy-pieces
game, the first thing that must
be seen to is the protection of
the king, since the side which
can combine the advance of its
pawns with threats to the oppos-
ing king will hold the initia-
tive in such endings. In this
position, White's advantage boils
down to his having more pawns on
the f- and h-files, with the f-
pawn being especially important,
as it shields the king from
checks on the diagonal h2-b8.
The difference in the positions
of the respective kings is clear-
ly visible from the diagram.

could probably have gotten a draw

want to risk it, since he thought
he could stop White's attack by
simpler means — which, as un-
fortunately happens so often,
turned out to be more complex.


36. ad Qd7-d2












Keres assumed that the f-
pawn could not be defended,
for example: 37 Kg3 Qd3+; but
he overlooked the fact that
advancing the pawn would se-
cure the g6 square for White, and
create a new possibility of at-
tacking the g/-pawn. He would
have been better off attacking
the pawn from the other side:
36..Qf7, which also attacks the
£5 square; if then 37 g3 Q£5.

In fierce time-pressure, Keres

could have cost him the game.


38. Qe5:a5 b6é:a5

By defending his f-pawn again,
Taimanov slackens his initiative

king; the latter circumstance
allows Keres to create a threat
to the white a-pawn and force
the draw. With the more active
continuation 39 Re5, Taimanov


would have retained his plus
pawn in all lines, with real
winning chances.

39. R£8-b8

The rook makes for the open
sea; since the pawns are dead
even, White's advantage has
completely evaporated.

The most beautiful game of

has drawn rave reviews from the
entire chess world. "Once in a
hundred years..", “Unique in
chess literature..", "Exquisite
queen sacrifice.."' — such were
the feelings of commentators of
many lands, although none of
them could match the reaction in


[159]


the tournament hall. To this we
may add that the Averbakh - Ko-
tov game now has a spot in the
golden treasury of chess art.

In the previous round, Petro-

against Kotov and obtained good
play. In this tournament, Kotov
generally answered 1 d4 with
1..d5, or else played the King's
Indian; for this game, however,
he adopted Petrosian's idea, em-
ploying it impromptu against
Averbakh.


In the previous game, White had
continued 6 g3, fianchettoing his
bishop; here Averbakh uses the
other method of developing it,

6 Be2. This would make sense if
he followed it up with an advance
of his queenside pawns, but he
does not carry his plan through
to its logical conclusion.

The immediate 11 a3 would have
been a poor idea, since Black
would have exchanged in the cen-
ter, exposing the e-pawn, and
then advanced his a-pawn, pre-
venting b2-b4.

This position is one of dynam-
ic equality, requiring great
skill from both sides. Black can
undertake a diversion on either
the queenside (for example, ..Rec8,
..cd and ..b5) or the kingside
(..Kh8, ..Ng8 and..f£5). Neither
would present any deadly danger
to White, provided he takes pre-
ventive measures. The only dan-
ger would be that he might allow
himself to become so wrapped up
in meeting the threats on one
wing as to miss the critical mo-


ment on the other.

This move is the equivalent
of an announcement, with fan-
fares, that Black has chosen
the kingside as his main theater
of operations. White should now
have lost no time preparing
a2-a3 and b2-b4: for example,
18 Qc2 Kh8 19 a3 Ng8& 20 Bed,
and if 20..Nf£6, he can trade
bishops and open the b-file.

20. Be2-g4 Ng8-h6

Since White here declines a
possible repetition of the po-
sition (21 Be2 Ng8), evidently
he feels his chances are not
inferior. He is correct, inasmuch
as he has the possibility of
playing a2-a3, Rb1 and b2-b4;
but he is also incorrect, inas-
much as he has something totally
different in mind.

Averbakh is trying to put out

..£7-£5 comes with double force,
since Black can capture either
of two pawns, while neither
white pawn may capture on f5.

Although many commentators
gave this move a question mark,
it cannot be considered a mis-
take; actually, it is the con-
tinuation of a plan begun much
earlier. Averbakh intends an
attack along the g-file, and
so he opens it. This is all very
logical — except that the h-
pawn has to be on h2.

The creative element of chess
is generally thought to consist


[160]


of three things: logic, accurate
calculation, and technique (this
last includes a knowledge of the-
ory). There is a fourth ingre-
dient also, however, perhaps the
most intriguing of all, although
it is often overlooked. I refer
to intuition — chess fantasy,
if you prefer.


Occasionally a position arises
in the course of a game which
cannot be evaluated on general
principles, such as pawn weak-
nesses, open lines, better de-
velopment, etc., since the state
of equilibrium has been upset on
several counts, rendering an ex-
act weighing of the elements im-
possible. Attempting to calculate
the variations doesn't always
work, either. Imagine that White
has six or seven different con-
tinuations, and Black five or
six replies to each move; it's
easy to see that no genius on
earth could reach even the fourth
move in his calculations. It is
then that intuition or fantasy
comes to the rescue: that's what
has given the art of chess its
most beautiful combinations, and
allowed chessplayers the chance
to experience the joy of creating.


It is not true to say that in-
tuitive games were only played
in the days of Morphy, Anders-
sen and Chigorin (as if now, in
our era, everything were to
be based totally on positional
principles and rigorous calcul-
eibEt) I remain convinced that,
even in the games which received
the brilliancy prizes at this
tournament,not all of the varia-
tions were calculated to the end.
Intuition has been and remains
one of the cornerstones of chess
creativity — of which we shall
now see proof positive.

30. Qd7 :h3+

Now the weakness of the pawn
at h3 tells. The point of Ko-
tov's remarkable combination,
which all his previous play went
to prepare, is to drag the white
king out to £5, where it will
be defenseless against Black's
two rooks, knight and bishop;
while White's five pieces, deep
in his rear echelon, can only
look on from afar.

Like a rabbit hypnotized by a
python, the king advances un-
willingly to the place of its
doom. For an understanding of
the next phase of the game, bear
in mind that Kotov had very lit-
tle time left until the time con-
trol, and naturally did not wish
to spoil such a beautiful and
unusual game with some hasty
move. Therefore, he decides to
give a few checks, in order to
get the game past the 40th move
and adjourn it. No doubt, there
has to be mate in this position;
most probably, Kotov saw its
basic outlines as far back as
his 30th move.

33. ents N£6-d7?

Here's the proof: had the
queen sacrifice been "accur-
ately calculated", Kotov would
instead have chosen Stahlberg's
postmortem suggestion, 33..Ng4,
depriving White of the reply
34 Rg5. After 33..Ng4, White
would have had to suffer colos-
sal material losses in order to
avert the mate threats.

do anything with them, since all

ricades or under the crossfire

Black meets the flank develop-
ment of the bishop by advancing
his c-pawn to support ..d7-d5,
setting up a symmetrical posi-
tion with a fixed pawn struc-
ture. Stahlberg is challenging
Euwe the openings theoretician,


[162]


by making it very difficult for
White to get an advantage.


Euwe does not try to refute
the opening, which is impossible,
but to upset the statistical ba-
lance and create livelier play,
trusting that the advantage of
the first move will make itself
felt somewhere. Stahlberg is
willing to meet Euwe halfway,
and the game which results is
very much like an absorbing nov-
elette.

It is not entirely clear where

9. 0-0 Nd7-b6
10. a2-a4 cia


Like Tarrasch in his day, Euwe
cannot abide the sight of an en-
emy knight on b6. But the knight
stands so poorly on that square
that there was no need to dis-
turb it. The quiet 10 Nd4 and
11 b3 would have underscored the
knight's limited mobility, while
the flank deployment of the sec-
ond bishop would harmoniously
complement the ensemble of white
pieces.


Euwe intends to develop the
bishop at e3: it must have been
in order to rid himself of the
temptation to advance the e-
pawn...

the important square c6 for his
knight.

Stahlberg did not retreat to
d7 immediately, fearing 13 Qb3,
when the attempt to take the
d5-pawn would end very badly
for Black: 12..Bd7 13 Qb3 Nf:d5
14 N:d5 B:d4 15 Bh6, and Black
must cede the exchange, as oth-
erwise White could threaten the
knight at b6 and mate at g7 sim-
ultaneously, with serious diffi-
culties for Black. And if, after
13 Qb3, Black does not take the
d-pawn, but continues instead
with 13..Qc7, 14 Be3Nc4 15 Rfcl
sets up an unpleasant pin on
the c-file.


Thus, the black bishop can
find no fulcrum from which to
exert its leverage, and wanders
mournfully along the diagonal
c8-h3: it has taken three moves
to get from c8 to d7! That's
quite enough to induce White to
start an attack: with 14 a5, the
black knight would have been
driven back to c8, where it in-
terferes with the coordination
of Black's rooks, and would have
had a lot more skulking about to
do, too.

Qd1-d2


Black is spoiling for a fight!
Stahlberg was probably attracted
less by the prospect of winning
the pawn than by the piquant po-
sition of the rook on c5, a square
where it would appear to be vul-
nerable, yet cannot be attacked.
Evidently, he was not yet will-
ing to sacrifice the rook for
knight and pawn by 15..R:c3
16 Q:c3 Nb:d5, but in his cramped
position he could hardly hope
to obtain anything better. Stahl-
berg still keeps the possibility
of trading off the rook in this
fashion for the next two moves,
but he stubbornly maintains its
position on c5.

16. Nd4-c6

A valiant charge! The knight
may be taken by rook, bishop or
pawn: which is best? Stahlberg
follows the line of greatest re-
sistance: instead of one minor
piece for the rook, he gets two,
but his opponent gets an ex-
tremely dangerous passed pawn.
Other possible lines: 16..B:c6
17 de Ric3 18 Q:c3 Nd5 19 c7;
or 16..Nf£:d5 17 N:d8 B:c3, etc.

Black sees that he must bring
up his sleeping kingside pieces
as quickly as possible, and to
that end he sacrifices yet ano-
ther pawn; however, such dras-
tic measures were as yet unnec-
essary. 23..Nfe8 was better, in-


tending ..Nd6 and ..Bc3.
24. Ne5:a6 Nc7:a6
25. Bg2:d5 Be6 :h3


It would have been tempting
to trade off the bishops aswell,
picking up the c-pawn, but this


would have led to a quick fin-
ish: one white rook would go
to the eighth rank, while the
other supported the advance of
the b-pawn.

26. Bd5-g2 Bh3-e6

Here too, he cannot exchange
bishops, and for the same rea-~
son.
27. Rdi-b1 Bg7-c3

He ought to have found out
where the rook intended to go
after 27..Bf£5: the choice was
not great. Stahlberg apparently
feared White would take a draw
by repetition of moves, and he
was loath to abandon a game that
had proven so interesting...

Black's pointless maneuverings
have allowed White to improve the
positions of his pieces. One of
Black's drawing chances lay in
avoiding an exchange of light-
square bishops, which keeps the
possibility of giving back the
two pieces for the rook and pawn,
leaving opposite-colored bishops.
For this reason, he should have
brought his lightsquare bishop
to e6 only after the preparatory
31..Nc7.

Rc8~-b8

















[164]


Three connected passed pawns
can be a terrible weapon when
they start rolling and smash-
ing all before them. Cases are
known in which such pawns have
defeated two rooks, or even a
queen and rook; so Stahlberg
must take the b-pawn. He cannot
take it with the rook, since af-
ter the last black rook is ex-
changed off, White plays Rd5-
b5-b6 and then queens his a-
pawn. Taking on b4 with the bi-
shop would be bad too, in view
of 35 c7. Luckily for Stahl-
berg, he can still wriggle out
of his difficult situation by
giving back the two pieces for
rook and pawn to get into a
slightly inferior rook endgame.

The game enters its third, and
most interesting, phase.


The tale of chess tournaments
has furnished us a wealth of ma-
terial on the theory and prac-
tice of rook endgames; this end-
game, played by both sides with
a high degree of skill, cer-
faintly belongs among the best.
Black's task is a most difficult
one: he has to cope with an out-
side passed pawn. He does have
counterchances, however: the
possibility of quickly creating
a matching passed pawn on the h-
file, and the fact that there is
so little material left on the
board. This latter circumstance
sometimes allows one to trade
off all his pawns, give up the
rook for the last of the enemy
pawns, and then force one's op-
ponent to repay his debt in the
same coin.


We are largely indebted to
Dr. Euwe's analysis for the fol-
lowing commentaries.

38. Sis Kg8-£8

The king would be better
brought via g7 and £6 to e5, but
that doesn't come off: 38..Kg7/
39 Kg2 K£6 40 Kf£3 Ke5 41 a6 Ra?
42 RaS+ d5 43 e4, and White wins
a pawn. The reason this turns
out in White's favor is that
the white rook stands behind its


far-advanced pawn, and thus has
freedom to maneuver; the same
cannot be said of Black's rook,
which stands in front of the
passed pawn and will have fewer
and fewer squares as the pawn
advances further. This is quite
a basic element in the evalua-
tion of rook endings, and will
figure prominently in the strug-
gle at hand.

If Black should succeed in
creating a passed pawn on the
h-file, things will not be so
bad for him.

42, eee h7=h5
43. f£2-£4 eee

Euwe already sees Black's
plan of ..f7-f6, ..g6-g5 and
.-h5-h4, and wishes to keep
in hand the possibility of
creating an outpost at f5,
thereby maintaining winning
chances after a mutual liquid-
ation of passed pawns.


43. aed Ra7-a6é

Here Euwe's analysis indi-
cates it would have been better
to begin at once with the cre-
ation of a passed pawn by 43..f6,
followed by:

I. 44 a6 2¢5 45 £5 h4 46 gh gh

ing is drawn, since the king
gets back just in time to de-
fend the pawn on f6;


TI. 44 Ra3 g5 45 £5 h4 46 gh gh
47 Ke4 h3 48 Kf3 d5 49 Kg3 Kd6o
50 K:h3 Ke5, drawing;


III. 44 e4 Ra6, with the same
ideas as in the game, but with
an extra tempo for Black.


44, e2-e4


He shouldn't have taken the
e4 square away from his king.
This is important in the follow-
ing variation: 44 Ra2 f6 45 Ra3

49 Kf3 h2 50 Kg2 Kc6 51 K:h2 Kb5

and White picks up the f-pawn
and queens one move before Black.
The same thing occurs after
48..Kc6 49 K£4 Kb5 50 Kg4 R:a5
51 R:a5+, etc. But now that a
pawn bars the white king's path,
Black can go in for this varia-
tion —- which, indeed, he does.

The crux of this remarkable
endgame, and in fact of the en-
tire game. Stahlberg quite evi-
dently thought that he could sup-


port his passed h-pawn in some
lines; how could he have seen
that it was precisely the para-
doxical 48..Ra7 which would have
held the draw? As Euwe shows in
his analyses: 49 a6 Kc6, and
now:


a) 50 Ra3 h3 51 R:h3 R:a6 52 Rh6

55 Rh7+ Ke8 56 Ke6 d5+ 57 K:d5
RaS+ 58 Kd4 Re5 and draws.


With the rook at a8, White's
pawn goes to a7; then, in varia-
tion b), after the trade of
pawns, White checks at h7 and
wins the rook.


49, a5-a6 Kd7=c6
50. a6-a7 h4-h3


The attempt to trade passed
pawns by 50..Kb7 51 Rh2 R:a7
52 Rth4 would lose for Black,
since his king would not have
the time to get back in order
to defend his pawns: 52..Kc6
53 Rh6 R£7 54 Rh8 Re7 55 Kd4
Rf7 56 Rg8, and Black is in
zugzwang.


51. Ke4-d4 Kce6-c7


If Black had advanced his
passed pawn to the second rank,
White would not have taken it
off at once, but given check
from c2 first; with the black
king confined to the b-file,
White would have an easy win.


52. Kd4-d5 Kce7-d7


53. Ra2-a3 h3-h2
54. Ra3-al 3


Underscoring all the short-
comings of Black's position:
now he has no useful move. For
example, after 54..h1Q 55 R:hl
R:a7 56 Rh7+, White wins the
rook at a7. If Black prepares
this by retreating his king to
the eighth rank, White places
his king in opposition, setting
up a mate threat after the ex-
change of pawns. If 54..Ke7,
then obviously 55 Ke6 and
56 Kb7. Black tries to play on
for a while a pawn down, but
that's clearly hopeless.

Euwe plays the Boleslavsky Var-
iation against its inventor: a
bit of psychology that often
brings good results. To his psy-
chological preparations, the
former World Champion has also
added a theoretical improvement
at the 14th move.


Boleslavsky plays the game
peaceably, even somewhat weakly,
and Euwe succeeds in equalizing
completely.

The players are traveling a
well-rutted road: the whole
line was played repeatedly at
the Stockholm tournament in
1952. There, Black played 14..a6;
but after 15 a3 Qc4, White was
able to pin Black's knight with
16 Bg5. This move of Black's
forestalls that bishop sortie
and preserves the knight's
freedom of movement. For exam-
ple, he can play ..Nh7, intend-
ing ..Bg5, or ..Nd/7 followed by
..Nc5. In the Stockholm games,
Black had to spend a tempo de-
fending the bishop by ..Qc7 in
order to relieve the pin, and
then the knight had to go toes.

Here's a surprise: one would
think that Black would have to
keep two pieces watching the d5
square, so that if White ever
occupies it, he would have to
recapture with his pawn in the
event of an exchange, shutting
off his pressure on the d6-pawn.
But now Black seems willing to


[167]


give up his "good" bishop for
White's knight, and it appears
that White can now occupy d5
with a piece. Euwe, however, by
advancing his queenside pawns
and posting his own knight on
c5, thwarts White's efforts to
install his bishop at d5.

Indirect defense is an often-
used technique: it can figure as
one of the elements of a combin-
ation, or as one of the linksin
a war of maneuver. In the dia-
grammed position, the d6-pawn
is defended indirectly, since if
25 Q:d6 Q:d6 26 R:d6é, Black can
snap off the b3-pawn, formerly
defended by both the queen and
the c-pawn, with his knight.

Euwe has carried out one of
the fundamental ideas of the
Boleslavsky Variation by occu-
pying d4 with his knight. The
pawns at a4 and d6 are approx~
imately equivalent, but Black's

100. Kotov—Szabo
(King’s Indian)

Castling on opposite wings
generally presages pawn assaults
against the opposing kings. An
exception to this rule consists
of the unusual positions aris-
ing out of the Samisch King's
Indian. Here both sides, after
castling on opposite wings,
sometimes push the pawns in
front of their own kings. The
present game is an example of
such play. With the center
closed and pawn chains fixed,
Black castles short and sets
up a break on g4 by playing
..£7-£5-£4, ..g6-g5, ..h7-h5,
and ..g5-g4; in the meantime,
White opened the b-file leading
to his own king for his opponent.
This sort of original play on
both sides led to offensive
breakthroughs on opposite wings,
flanking piece maneuvers, and
sharp cut-and-thrust play.


The unusual strategic idea,
the resourceful and daring play
on both sides, and the beauti-
ful concluding combinations
make this game altogether an
exceptionally interesting one.

with 9..f4. Szabo maintains the
central tension and the possi-
bility of posting his knight at
£4,

10. Bfl-d3 Nd7-c5

And right now was the proper

moment to put this plan into


execution: 10..Nf£4!, and if the
bishop goes to c2, then 11..Nb6
(instead of ..Nc5) assails the
weakened c-pawn and induces

12 b3.


11. Bd3-c2 £5-f£4


“

=





Szabo turns down that same
rocky road as did Gligoric in
the game just mentioned with
Geller, thus consigning himself
to a protracted and difficult
defense, too. In the meantime,
Kotov has a clear plan, which
Makogonov used successfully
again and again in such posi-
tions: the king goes to bl, and
the knight on gl goes to d3,
either squeezing Black's knight
out of c5 or else inducing the
weakening ..b/7=b6; meanwhile,
his rooks occupy the c- and d-
files. Gradually, White pre-
pares the break c4=c5, during
which his king will have two
pawns' protection; while Black,
in order to set his kingside
counterbreak in motion, must
strip his king absolutely bare
of pawn cover.


In this game, matters do not
move along quite as smoothly as
we have just described it, but
that's the general scheme; soon
the scales begin to tip in
White's favor. Thus, Black
should not have closed the game
here, either: 11..Nf6 was bet-
ter, maintaining pressure on
e4 and preventing 12 Nge2 tac-
tically, because of the contin-
uation 12..fe 13 fe Ng4 or
13 Bic5 ef.

Szabo is on the horns of a
dilemma. Seeing that his inten-
ded 13..b5 will not work, in
view of 14 b4 and 15 c5, he
decides to secure the knight's
position, at least. He conducts
the next phase of the game some-
what hesitantly, as though try-
ing to decide what plan he ought
to adopt in the face of White's
growing initiative. After the
20th move, however, he decides
on a pawn assault leading away
from his own king, and plays


va banque.

Obsessed by his desire to ex-
change off the darksquare bi-
shops, Szabo overlooks White's
simple reply. 18..a4 was neces-
sary, in order to prevent the
trade of lightsquare bishops,
at least, and to deprive White's
pieces of the square b3.


19. Bf2:c5 Ske


In removing his bishop from
£6, Black left the e5-pawn un-
protected, so that now he must
recapture the bishop with his
b-pawn. Strange as it may seem,
the line thus opened will turn
into an artery of communications
for White's pieces, and not for
Black's. The strategy and tac-
tics of chess still hold many a
paradox.


19, abla b6:c5
20. Bc2-a4 sree


A maneuver with the same idea
as Black's ..Bg7-f6-h4, but this
one is more successful. Black
cannot sidestep the exchange of
his "good" bishop, since re-
treating it to c8 would put him
in a squeeze. After 21 Bc6 Raé
22 Nb5, it would be Black's turn
to seek this exchange.


20. aoe Bd7:a4
21. Ne3:a4 Qd8-d7
22. Na4-c3 g6-g5


Black is now in real danger


of losing: the threat is 23 Nb5,
24 Rc3, and 25 Ra3, and there
seems to be no way to defend the
a-pawn, especially since White
can also bring up a second knight
to b3. In this position, with its
fixed pawn chain, White's knights
have great power. Szabo decides
to utilize his mobile units where
they stand, i.e. on the king's
wing; as a result, the game im-
mediately changes character. The
preceding unhurried maneuvering
gives way to bitter hand-to-hand
fighting, requiring a cool head,
resourcefulness and accuracy.

moves, while simultaneously
counteracting the enemy plan

play is beyond praise. He leaves
one rook to withstand the as-
sault, and continuously com-
bines attack with defense.

Black defends the a-pawn indi-
rectly, intending to undermine
g2, the keystone of the sturdy
bridge of white pawns.

30, Nd3-cl Qh7-h1!

By completing the pons flank-
ing maneuver ..Qd7-h7-hl, the
black queen becomes the first
to invade the enemy camp, leav-~
ing to its fate not only the
c-pawn and the rook, but its
king as well, However, Black
had no other recourse, since
otherwise his a-pawn would have
fallen without compensation.
Still, White's last move under-
scored his obvious advantage,
which consists of: 1) the bet-
ter-protected king, 2) his knight,
which is a much more dangerous
weapon in an attack on the op-
posing king than Black's bi-
shop; and 3) the pawn White
wins in the course of his at-
tack, as well as the tempo he
wins by his attack on the rook.
All this gives sufficient basis
for many combinations; it is
the master's skill to select
from among those combinations
the best and decisive ones.

Szabo is setting a trap. Ob-
viously, the bishop cannot be
taken, either by rook or pawn.
If White takes the knight, we
get the well-known "windmill":
39 Q:d7? Q:b2+! 40 R:b2 R:b2+
41 Kal, and now Black can give
discovered check by moving his
rook to any of a dozen squares.
Generally that would be enough
to give him at least a draw;
here, after 41..Rb7+ 42 Ka2
R:d7, it would even win.

A beautiful concluding move to
an outstandingly played game.
White attacks the bishop and
closes the second rank. If the
queen takes this knight, then
g7 is left unprotected, and
White has a mating finish by
sacrificing his rook as well:

with mate in three.

The last two moves for both

[171]


Rauzer line against the Sici-
lian, with its 6 Bg5, 7 Qd2 and
8 0-0-0, White generally does
not get to bring out his light-
square bishop in the early
stages; in the Scheveningen,
White develops both bishops,
but to humbler posts: e2 and
e3. In this game, Geller de-
cides to develop both his bi-
shops actively, and apparently
he wishes to castle queenside
too. If he could manage all this,
he would stand beautifully. He.
began his plan with 6 Bc4, pre-
venting, among other things, the
Dragon Variation, in view of
6..g6 7 N:c6 be 8 e5S!, when cap-
turing is obviously impossible
because of 9 B:f7+, winning the
queen. 8..Ng4 would be neces-
sary instead, when the pawn ad-
vances further still: 9 e6 £5
10 0-0, with an active game for
White, following the ancient
game Schlechter - Lasker (Match
1910).


Averbakh's 6..Bd7 prepares to
enter the Dragon Variation.
White could simply have castled
here, the likely continuation
being 7..g6 8 h3 Bg7 9 Be3 0-0
10 Bb3, with a good game. But
he persists with his idea and
plays 7 Bg5.


Averbakh meets this with a
daring and original counterplan:
forcing White to take his king's
knight (there being no other way
to defend both the bishop on g5
and the pawn on e4), and leaving
his king where it stands, he in-
itiates a fierce kingside attack
right out of the opening. Gene-
rally, such strategy runs coun-
ter to chess principles; but in
this case the open g-file gives
Black two developed major pieces,
and a powerful pawn center as
well. It was just this curious
concatenation of circumstances
that gave rise to such an unu-
sual plan.


Geller regards Black's attack
as of no consequence, and delib-
erately castles kingside, push-
ing his kingside pawns as if to
invite his opponent's attack. Of
course, that attack poses no mor-
tal threat to White's king, but
some preventive measures were
still in order. Among other
things, 9 Bd5 would have been
a great deal better than his


9 Nb3: first the queen must be
cut off from the kingside, and
then 10 Nb3 will be a threat.

Black gives up all thought of
castling, but such fortitude was
not dictated by necessity. Of
course the black king is per-
fectly safe behind its barbed-
wire fence of d6-e7-f7-f6, with
all its pieces close by; but un-
der these circumstances, the
center pawns are not being ex-
ploited to the fullest possible
extent. The black king's bishop
also will not be able to parti-
cipate in the game for a long
time, and the struggle cannot
be won without it.


After 12..0-0-0, intending to
continue with ..e/7-e6 and ..d6-

center very favorably and ob-
tained definite winning chances.

has his passed pawn already,
whereas Black's pawn on a7 can
only become passed over the dead

transfer of the knight to b3 is
played in the faint hope of dis-
tracting White's attention from
the events in the center, and
inducing the exchange of at least
one white bishop, but on b3 the
knight is too far from the cen-

Smyslov plays a move that he
will have to make anyway before
adjournment, so as to make his
opponent do the thinking before
sealing, and also to make it
harder for him to analyze the
adjourned position.

Chess miracles, as opposed to
the other sort, still happen on
occasion, thanks to chessplayers
fantasy and the game's endless
possibilities. In this — to
all appearances, absolutely
lost — position, Petrosian com-
poses a study: Black to move
and draw, and demonstrates the
solution to Smyslov after ad-
journment.

A move of rare beauty. If
White queens, he is mated in
two moves; if he trades queens,
he loses the d-pawn; and if he
retreats by 47 Qd4,Q:h2 forces
perpetual check,


Convinced that a genuine mir-
acle had come to pass, Smyslov
resigned himself to the loss of
a half-point, and forced the
draw with a sham queen sacrifice.

However, as it turns out, mir-
acles are sometimes no more than
optical illusions in chess as
well: 47 Qd6 would have allowed
White to defend the h-pawn, skew-
er-fashion, through Black's
queen. On 47..Nf2+ there follows
48 Kh4 g5+ 49 Kh5; and on any
other Black reply to 47 Qd6
White simply makes another queen,
and his king easily escapes the
checks,


Curiously, neither of the play-
ers, nor the tournament partici-
pants, nor the spectators, no-
ticed this possibility for White.

A quiet line of the Sicilian.
The play, as you can see, leads
to a nearly symmetrical posi-
tion, the only difference being
that the black pawns face the
queen's wing, while White's
face the center. This factor
predetermines further planning
on both sides. Keres does not
employ this unhurried maneuver-
ing system very often, and he
later commits a number of inac-
curacies, allowing Black, first
to equalize, and then to get the
better of it.


7. Bel-e3 0-0
8. h2-h3 5. Sie


Smyslov, who best knows the
Closed System and plays it like
a virtuoso, prefers 8 Qcl here,
intending to trade off the dark-
square bishops; if Black fore~
stalls this by 8..Re8 9 Bh6 Bh8,
only then 10 h3. The queen's
move to cl, instead of d2, is
made with the idea of answering
8,.Ng4 by 9 Bd2.


8. ee Nf£6-e8


Black clearly intends to put
a knight on d4. Now was White's
last opportunity for 9 d4; fail-
ing to play it, he cedes his
opponent a spatial advantage.

Black is already prepared to
advance the b-pawn, while White
hasn't even castled yet. His
next maneuver has as its aim
the removal of the knight from
d4 and the advance of his pawn
to that square, but this plan
is doomed to fail. The best plan
now was simply to take the
knight and play 12 Bh6, so that
Black's pawn advance would at
least be deprived of the sup-
port of his king's bishop.

White's knight which must re-
treat, and d3-d4 will never oc-
cur. More: Black immediately
plays ..d6-d5 and ..f7- £5, tak-
ing over the center completely.

Najdorf gives his opponent no

path is blocked by 18 £4, then
18..Ne6, and the knight enters
the fray with tremendous effect.
After the exchange of pawns at

ing 19..Bd3; and so the white
knight, for the sake of whose

freedom White played 16 c4,
never gets to c3 at all.

White's game is lost: he has
no advantages whatsoever to
compensate him for the pawn.

The continuation 22 Ne3 Ne6

23 Rad1l Q:e3 24 Bre3 Nd4 would
hold out no prospects for him,
so he seeks somehow to change
the normal course of events. He
offers Black the option of win-
ning another pawn, with 22..B:a2,
or sacrificing the exchange him-
self. Both the one and the other
would favor Black:


1) 22..B:a2 23 b3 Ne6 24 Q:d4

with an easy win;


2) 22..B£7 23 Q:d4 ed! 24 Bf4
Rbce8 25 Bb7 Nd5! 26 B:c8 N:f4
27 gf Ric8, with a winning po-
sition; or if White plays 26 Bd6
(instead of 26 B:c8), then

26 ..Nb4, or 27 Baé (instead of
27 gf) 27..d3 is not bad.


Najdorf disdains both acquir-
ing and sacrificing material,
expecting the win to be a mat-
ter of simple technique after
the trade of queens. However,
this exchange substantially im-
proves White's position, chief-
ly by bringing his knight back
into the game; later, Black also
allows White's rook to reach the
seventh.

Black has simplified the game

There was something to be said


for 31..Bf8, too — mainly that
after 32 Ra7 Rf7 33 R:f7 K:£7
34 Rd7+, he could bring his
king to the center. Of course,
Black could expect to lose a
pawn in the line 32 R:e5 Bg7

be left with all of the chances.

33. Rdl-d7+ Kf7-g8
34.  b2-b3 b6-b5


Black induced 34 b3 by his
threat of 34..c4 and 35..e4;
now he is able to set about
creating his passed pawn by
making use of the following
standard technique: 35..c4
36 be, and now he does not re-
capture White's pawn, but in-
stead pushes his own pawn on
to queen with 36..b4. Why must
Black continue this way? Be-
cause, by recapturing at c4,
he allows White's rook, by
going to c7, to force him to
defend his pawn from the side,
after which the pawn could no
longer take even one step fur-~
ther; White could then move
his king up and take it.


After the inevitable ..c5-c4
and ..b5-b4, White will be ina
real spot. Within three moves,
Black's pawn will reach the
first rank, so its march must
be halted, and not later than
b2. In these circumstances, the
proper plan would be: 35 Kfl c4
36 be b4 37 Bcl b3 38 Rd2 (per-
haps also 38 c5 b2 39 B:b2 and
40 c6) and 39 Bb2, when the
pawn is stopped; or 37..Rc8
38 Rb7 R:c4 39 Bd2 BE8 40 g5,
when Black could hardly hope
to win.


With 35 Rc7, White places his
rook in front of his pawn, and
also deprives himself of the op-
portunity of playing Rd2. Now
the above variations are no long-
er operative, and White must
give up a piece for the pawn.

The fortieth move! By recap-
turing with his bishop, Black
would have entered a difficult,
but still most probably won,
endgame: 40..B:b2 41 Rd7 Rc8
42 c7? BE6 43 Kfl Kf£8, followed
by ..Be7 and ..Ke8; if 44 R:h7,
then 44..Bg7.


41. Re7-d? eee
DRAW


Despite his extra piece,
Black cannot win. After 41..Rce2
42 c7, Black's only reasonable
move is 42..Bf8. Now the bishop
cannot move anywhere, because
of the check on d8, the king
cannot cross the seventh rank,
and the rook can only move up
and down the c-file. Remember
this position!

them.


6, cece Bb4-e7
7. c4:d5 e6:d5
8. Ne2-g3 oe


Reshevsky likes this opening
position, even though theory
does not, considering that Black
equalizes with 8..c5. Reshevsky
obviously has his own opinions
on that score, since he has al-
ways been willing to enter the
Ngl-e2-¢3 line, and plays it
outstandingly well.


His opponents in this tour-
nament — Taimanov, and Aver-
bakh in Round 18 — declined
to play 8..c5 in favor of their
own more intricate, which is
not to say better, systems. I
still think that 8..c5 is the
simplest solution.


8. eisce R£E8-e8
9. b2=-b4 c7-c6
10. Bfl-d3 b7-b5


No very high level of chess
erudition is required to brand
this move anti-positional, and
to give it a fat question mark,
as almost every commentator has
done. Its bad points are quite
obvious. But the move was played
by an international grandmaster,
and he undoubtedly saw some good
in the move, this being that
Black fixes the pawn at b4, and
prepares to break with ..a7-a5,
aiming to isolate one of the
queenside pawns. As for the
weakness of the pawn at c6,
Black expects to close the c-
file with the maneuver ..Nb8-
d7-b6-c4, simultaneously bring-
ing this knight to a strong po-
sition also.


Perhaps Taimanov would not
have been quite so roundly con-
demned, had it been recalled
that the thoughtless 10..b5 was
played by Reshevsky himself
against Gligoric in a game from
their match in New York 1951.


11. Bel-d2 aoe


Gligoric also played in this
fashion against Reshevsky. The
modest bishop move is exception-
ally strong, and destroys both
of Black's hopes. The push 11..a5
would now be risky, on account
of 12 ba R:a5 13 a4! b4 14 Na2
Na6 15 B:a6; so Taimanov tries
bringing his knight to c4 first.


11. eae Nb8-d7
12. a3-a4


White would also have met 11..a6
with 12 a4, and even though
12..Bb7 would allow Black to
maintain b5, 13 Qb3 Nbd7 14 a5
would have prevented him from
getting his knight to c4.


12. bite Be7:b4
13. a4:b5 c6<c5
14. 0-0 c5-c4


White has the freer game. In
the present instance, this means
that the b5-pawn is a strong
damper on the opposing position,
the black d-pawn needs piece pro-
tection, and Black must also be
on his guard against a possible
knight incursion on £5. Exchang-
ing on d4 would not change the
basics of the position, but mere-
ly open another line for the bi-
shop at d2. Taimanov takes an
optimistic approach to the po-
sition by creating a protected
passed pawn, but this gives
White some other trumps. Above
all, by removing the central
tension, he frees his opponent
from worrying about his pawn
chain, and allows him to con-
centrate on active minor piece
play. As for the passed pawn,
its protector is itself in need
of protection, and will cause
Black no end of worry.


I would have preferred the
waiting move 14..Nb6.

Black intended to wrest the
befile away with 21..Rb6, but
now this move would achieve
nothing, since 22 Qa5 would
follow, when the rook must re-
turn to d6 (22..Nbd7 23 Na4
Rb8 24 Q:a6), and White then
definitely takes over the b-
file with 23 Na4&. Such moves,
easily passed over, can fre-
quently be more important than
a combination, and decide the
outcome of a game.


Black's position has clearly
deteriorated. White's further
plan is to step up the pressure
on the d5-pawn; Black does not
feel he can tolerate the knight
on £4, and so he exchanges it.

Despite this apparent weaken-

to the exchange, since it leaves
him master of the dark squares.
Utilizing the weakening ..g/7-g6
he had earlier forced upon Black,
his kingside pawn majority and
the growing power of his pair of
bishops, Reshevsky storms the
enemy king position with excep-
tional energy.


Nothing remains for Black but
to try to cut down the number
of active pieces on the board,
and to ward off the direct tac-
tical threats.

Black had no need to return the
knight to b8 on move 18: the
bishop on a6 was better defended
with 18..Qa8.

Black defends himself against

have to start looking after his

ened 31 g5. Losing time doesn't
really mean very much here, since
Black can't make any effective
improvement in the positioning
of his pieces. Taimanov defends
very resourcefully, as usual: his
play shows no sign of desponden-
cy. He tries constantly to set
his opponent some new problem —
not all that complex, perhaps,
but at least it takes up time,

Objectively, 37 Bc3 was best,

If, having castled, you see
that your opponent has closed the
center and is preparing | 7 dir-
ect pawn storm, then it's a good
idea to open a line Nefsrehond
in the region where his king is
or intends to be. On that prin-
ciple, Gligoric sets up some in-
teresting queenside play as ear-
ly as the ninth move, and ob-
tains a strong counter-initia-
tive.

Another form of the Samisch
Attack, with 5 h3 instead of
5 £3. The advantages of this
system are: two dark diagonals
are not weakened, the diagonal
di-h5 remains open, and the
square £3 as well — Black will
find it difficult to establish
his knight on h5, when it can
always be driven away by Be2.
There are disadvantages, too,
chief among them the fact that
e4 has no pawn protection, which
Gligoric skillfully exploits
later on.

White had his move to seal
here, and he could not find
enough strength to resist
playing 41 B:c5: first, because
it gave him a protected passed
pawn; and second, because it
gave his opponent a weak, block-
aded pawn at c5, and made it
easier for his own king to get
to b5. Nevertheless, this was
not the best move}; although it
did not let the win slip, it
complicated it considerably.
The bishop was a good one, and
this was not yet the time to
trade it. 41 Nfl was correct,
bringing back this knight which
has stood for thirty moves do-
ing nothing, while maintaining
all his threats. The difference
is that while it is on e3 the
bishop keeps Black's king out
of g5, so that White can spend
some time quietly improving his
position by transferring the
knight, let us say, via h2 to
g4; after that, B:c5 dc; Kd3
would lead to an easy win.

The bishop's foray to a6 forced
White to slow his usual tempo of
devélopment in the Queen's In-
dian. But Black's accomplishments
are fleeting: one bishop has al-
ready returned to its accustomed
place, and now the b-pawn's ad-
vance forces the other's retreat
as well’

White has kept the pawn from
going to d5; and if his knight
were on c3, he could strengthen
his position still further. With
the knight on d2, however, I
could find no plan that had any
future in it, either at the board
or at home. Black's pieces may
indeed be cramped, but they are
well coordinated; together with
Black's pawns, they form a very
solid structure. On the whole,
it seems to me that the best way
to meet the Queen's Indian is
not to allow it. White won two,
and Black six, of the fifteen
Queen's Indians played in this
tournament: an unenviable re-
sult. It was also an atypical
one: a more typical result would
have been for all fifteen to
have ended as draws.

Najdorf apparently came upon
this move while analyzing the

his long match against the same
opponent. In two of those games,


Najdorf defended with 8..Ng4,
though unsuccessfully. Whether
8..Re8 or 8..Ng4 is the better

that will have to be left open

It differs from Smyslov's sys-
tem (see Games139 and 184) in
that here the pawn is on c4 in-
stead of c3.


Theoreticians tell us that ..e/7-
e5 is difficult to get inagainst
this line, so Black generally
plays for ..c7-c5 instead, fol-
lowing up with a gradual advance
of his queenside pawns. Petro-
sian carries out only the first
part of this plan, and then both
sides spend a lot of time in slow
maneuvering, trying to induce
weaknesses.


It still seems to me that Black
has no reason not to try for ..e7-
e5. But even with the plan he
uses in this game, his 5..Nbd7
is a poor choice: 5..0-0 would
be better, in order to continue,
after 6 e3, with 6..c5, followed
by ..Nc6!

An interesting psychological
motif is becoming apparent here.
By making only "natural" and
"necessary" moves, Keres is try-
ing to deceive his opponent into
thinking that he plans nothing
more than the steady improve-
ment of his position. In fact,
he has something completely dif-
ferent in mind: Keres wants (it's
hard to believe this) to whip
up an attack on the h-file! To
that end, he keeps the knight at
h2 for a long time, waiting for
the moment when its appearance
at g4 will force Black to take
it off. Meanwhile, for form's
sake, he "presses" on b6, dé,
etc.

The minority attack is not just
an opening idea most frequently
employed in the Exchange Varia-
tion (actually the Carlsbad Var-
jation) of the Queen's Gambit De-
clined, but a general strategic
idea, which under the right cir-
cumstances may be employed at
any stage of the game, and not
just on the queenside. The point
of this attack is to give the
opponent weaknesses in the sec-
tor where he holds a quantita-
tive pawn majority, and then to
attack the weak pawns with
pieces.


Here the circumstances are
exceptionally favorable for a
White minority attack on the
queen's wing. Generally Black,
in order to equalize, must un-
dertake a piece attack on the
king.

Why is White delaying his b2-
b4? Black would reply 14..Be4,
when 15 Nd2 would be impossible,
with the g-pawn loose. White
does not want to give up his
knight for Black's bishop ei-
ther, since that bishop is ham-
pered by its own pawns. However,
Black's next move puts a long-
time crimp on the white b-pawn's


[186]


advance.


14, arene a7-a5

In order to prevent the mino-
rity attack, the pawn separates
from its base and becomes a tar-
get itself. Sometimes it happens
that such a pawn draws a string
of black pawns after it, like a
needle pulling thread; in the
present situation, however, Av-
erbakh isn't concerned with
its defense yet. What he has
accomplished is that White must
now set about regrouping his
pieces toward a new goal (as-
sailing the a-pawn); Black uses
this time to be the first to
create threats on the kingside.

This transfer of the rook to
g4 illustrates Black's counter-
chances in this type of position.
Usually during the minority at-
tack White's king is left ei-
ther completely devoid of piece
protection or else covered by
just one minor piece. It's not


easy, though, to break through
to the king by means of a pawn
storm, so the most popular me-
thod is the direct frontal as-
sault, especially when g2 and
h2 provide such excellent tar-
gets for the pieces. Should
White have to advance his g-
or h-pawn, only then should
Black bring in his pawns. The
success of such an operation
depends upon the concrete pe-
culiarities of the position.
In the present instance, Smy-
slov was not in a risk-taking
mood: calling off his attempt
to win the a-pawn, he decides
to force the draw. A moral vic-
tory for Black.

from play. In such cases, the
opening of lines generally fav-
ors the better developed side.

achieve this functions as bait.

White could look forward to a
good harvest, not only of the

This was a mistake. The game
was adjourned here, with White
having not the slightest advan-
tage: Black's queen and knight
stand too near his king. Appar-
ently unwilling to analyze the
position, Szabo called the ar-
biter and told him that the po-


[188]


sition had been repeated three
times, and was therefore drawn.
No one had kept score during
time-pressure, so it was only
with great difficulty that Gel-
ler was able to demonstrate to
Szabo the error of his ways, and
obtain the right to continue the
game. However, the move he sealed
was so poor as to require him,
once the game was resumed, to
expend quite as much energy to
demonstrate to Szabo that the
position was still a draw. In

the hurly-burly of tournament
play, it's not difficult to over-

112. Boleslavsky—Stahlberg
(French Defense)


1. e2-e4 e7-e6

3. Nbi-c3 Bf8-b4


Stahlberg is unwilling to play
his usual 3..Nf6, apparently
fearing to walk into some sort
of preparation. But playing
3..Bb4 is like jumping out of
the frying pan into the fire,
since Boleslavsky plays the
Nimzovich Variation quite a
lot himself, and is thoroughly
conversant with every Black
weakness.


O£ course, Stahlberg does make
a few changes in Black's normal
defensive layout, but he gets


into difficulties just the same.

Black has skillfully masked his
actual intentions, which has, in
turn, prevented White from put-
ting together a concrete plan of
attack; but here he mistakenly
lets himself be seduced by the
opportunity to open the f-file.
It brings him no benefit what-
ever, and after a few defensive
moves, White renews his onslaught.
Black would have been better ad-
vised to keep to his waiting
tactics, fitting his actions to
those of his opponent.

The tocsin sounds. The dark


[190]


squares are hopelessly weak,

and Boleslavsky begins method-
ically to increase his pressure.
The bishop on ci will return to
its appointed attacking diagonal
a3-f£8, the rooks will gather on
the f-file, the knight will en-
ter e5, and the pawns, supported
by the bishop at h3, will ad-
vance for the decisive break.
What can Black find to oppose
this? Very little, other than
passive defense.

Having achieved a won position,
White hesitates. 36 g5 immediate-
ly, or after the preparatory
36 B:d6, suggests itself: in
either case, the g-file is op-
ened, and thanks to his great
advantage in maneuvering space,
White would be able to set up a
winning attack. Now Black gets
time to pull his knight off the
£6 square, so that g4-g5, al-
though it is still playable, no
longer wins a tempo.

The knight could have been

case.

Black has managed to fortify

himself on the exact spot where

a breakthrough seemed inevitable.
The position has now closed up,
which deprives White's bishops
of the greater part of their ef-
fectiveness. White's best course
here would have been to content


[191]


himself with an immediate draw,
but he could not resist the temp-
tation of winning the queen.

Naturally, 42..Kh7 43 R:e8
Q:e8 44 R£8 would leave White
with a powerful attack; now,
however, only Black can have
any winning chances.

The pawn advances in order to
secure £3 for the knight which
is now on d7. Since the fian-
chettoed bishop also threatens
White's queen's knight, it might
seem that the maneuver ..Nd7-
e5-£3+ could not be prevented.
Stahlberg dissipates that illu-
sion by means of a forcing var-
iation.

So now White has won the ex-
change; but that was not the
reason his knight invaded e6
with check. If Black had time
to get in 37..h5, White's in-
itiative would wither, so:


37. h4-h5 Be3:el
38. h5:g6 Bel-c3
39. g6:h7 Rc 8-h8


An innocent~looking move that
conceals a dastardly trap. The
game is about even here, and
after 40 Kg2 and 41 Rhi1, the
draw would have been quite ob-
vious. But with his last move
in time-pressure, Stahlberg
trustingly attacks the bishop,
no doubt expecting that Black
would find nothing better


than 40..Bf6.
40.


Qe2-e3





The king fulfills three tasks
with one move: defending g5,
clearing the queen's path toh/7,
and avoiding the check — that's
important too! — in the event
of 41 Q:c3. What is memorable is
not just the idea of the combin-
ation, but the cleverness with
which it is carried out. Sudden-
ly, unexpectedly, the white king
is in trouble.

42, Qe3-f4 Qd7:h7
43. Kgli-f1 Qh7-hi+
44. Kfl-e2 Qhi-h5+!


Kotov plays this second part
of the game with uncommon ener-
gy and resourcefulness. White,
it would seem, was just waiting
for the chance to play g3-g4;
yet here is Black, giving him
the opportunity to play it with
tempo!


45. g3-24 Qh5: g4+
46. Qf4:g4+ £5:g4
47. Be2:e4+ Kg6-g5


Here's the rub: despite the
bishops of opposite color, White
has a lost game. Let's see why:


1)Black's bishop is supported,
and stands very well at d4,
while the same cannot be said
of the bishop at e4.


2) Black's king is far more ac-
tive than its white counterpart,
and in fact assumes a leading


[193]


y

role in the fight.


3) Nor are the pawns on f2
and g4 equivalent: where the
pawn on f2 is weak and needs
protection, the pawn on g4
stands ready to assist its
pieces in their assault on
the pawn at f2.


All of these advantages
would lose their importance
if White could just manage to
get the rooks traded off, but
he can't. The game's conclud-
ing phase is most instructive.

An important element of

simple means will not suffice
against White's position, Black
first removes his king to the

not be exposed by his upcoming

lows, and takes up station, so

Not a very good move. In Game
128 against Stahlberg, two
rounds later, Smyslov played
11..h6, and quickly achieved
full equality, while in his match
with Geller Smyslov successful-
ly employed 11..Bh5. Since White
cannot achieve anything with this

mind that perhaps 10 e4, or even

This is a King's Indian with
reversed colors; consequently,
White has an extra tempo. This
is a structure which has been
heavily used of late by Soviet
masters, and which demands a
great deal of alertness from
Black. Schemes which White can
well employ against the King's
Indian can prove lethal when
Black employs them a move be-
hind. Reshevsky chooses an ex-
change of center pawns, which
is approximately equivalent to
the line in which White plays
d4:e5. This generally leads
to complete leveling, but here
White manages to carry out the
advance of his e- and f-pawns
to the fifth rank.

White already stands somewhat





superior, thanks to his advan-

is to regroup his pieces, pre-
sently posted on the first two
ranks, in order to support the
further advance of his e- and
f-pawns. One very important fac-
tor in this is that his oppo-
nent has no active plan; in-
deed, Black's pieces spend the
next seven moves nearly inac-
tive, unless you consider the
transfer of the bishop to the
other long diagonal — which
of course could have been done
earlier, without wasting time
on the maneuver ..Bc8-e6-d7-c6.

White has already won the stra-
tegic battle: his opponent's
pieces have been driven back to
the last two ranks. The natural
plan now for White would be to
advance his f- and g-pawns for
a breakthrough on the kingside.
Petrosian takes a somewhat dif-
ferent course: by threatening
h4-h5:g6 etc., he induces the
blockading ..h6-h5; then he sac-
rifices a pawn with £4-f5! If
Black accepts, White's knight on
£2 goes, with great profit, to
£4 — an excellent stratagem.

White's position is far su-

are exchanged, Black's weak

Black's exposed king and the
continual need to watch over its
safety would tie Black hand and

king is quite secure. Neverthe-
less, Black should still have
played this, but with the idea
of attacking, not the king, but
the opposing center. After
12..B:c3 13 Q:c3 d5 or 13..e5,
we would have had some inter-
esting play, whereas now White
develops a clear advantage, and
Black must employ all of his
alertness.

Black's chief worry is how to

keep an eye out to prevent White
from entrenching his knight at
e5, or setting up the battery
Bbi1 and Qc2; if that does hap-
pen, he must have ..Nf8 ready.
Black has plenty of worries, as
may be seen. But it is a bore to
think only about defense: Black's
14..dce carries with it the hope
of exploiting the active posi-
tion of his fianchettoed bishop,
and perhaps the relative weak-
ness of the pawns at c4andd4.
Black would very much like one
of those two pawns to advance.
White also has the threat of
. Nf£6-g4 to deal with here.

119. Taimanov—Gligoric
(Sicilian Defense)


The sacrifice of a pawn for
the initiative is one of the
most complex problems of chess
strategy — and perhaps of its
psychology as well. The positions
that occur as the result of a
sacrifice are so varied that no
generalizations can possibly be
made. Some grandmasters, posses-~
sing the faculty of quick cal-
culation, not infrequently give
up a pawn or two simply to alter
the nature and balance of a po-
sition, even if this is perhaps
not in their favor. I don't
think this manner of playing has
much of a future. I myself have
sacrificed, all told, several
dozen pawns, but still I think
that the master who sacrifices
a pawn ought to have at least a
general idea of the nature of
the initiative he will thereby
obtain, and what sort of game
will ensue.


Once in a while, a pawn must
be given up, or even an exchange
or a piece, against one’s will —
the point being that any other
course leads to a difficult po-
sition. Playing White, Taimanov
sacrificed a pawn in the open-
ing, but obtained no more of an
initiative thereby than he might
have obtained by keeping the
same number of pawns as his op-
ponent. Throughout the game,
White put himself through ago-
nies trying to regain his pawn,
but never quite succeeded; even-
tually, Black's extra pawn went
on to queen.


1. e2-e4 e7-c5
2. Ngi-f3 d7-d6
3. Bfl-b5+


The exchange of lightsquare
bishops on the fourth move is
part of a far-seeing strategic
idea. Gligoric has placed his
pawns on dark squares, so Tai-~
manov thinks that with the
lightsquare bishop gone Black
will find it hard to maintain
the positional balance. Of
course, Black can advance his
center pawns to e6 and d5, but
that will take time.


3. ives Bc8-d7
4, BbS:d7+ Qd8:d7

6. Rfil-el bane





After the exchange of bishops,
I think it makes more sense to
put the pawn on the light square
d3 and the knight on c3 (where
it controls the light square d5),
and after Black plays ..e/7-e6 or
..g7-g6, to prepare the advance
£2-f4-£5. Taimanov acts illogi-
cally in selecting a plan which
helps Black to clear the c5-f8
diagonal, presently cluttered
with black pawns.


6. Sia Ng8-£6

White decides not to recapture

viously; he expects 8..e5 9 B:f6
gf 10 c3!, or 8..g6 9 B:f6 ef
10 N:d4, or 8..Ng4 9 N:d4 h6é

an excellent plan which knocks
the last white pawn out of the
center and secures active posi-
tions for Black's pieces.

13. c2-c3


Of course, Taimanov sees that
his strategic plans have come a
cropper: Black has a pawn more,
with the possibility of setting


up a powerful center, while the
white knights have no points of
support. The ability to make
exceptionally objective assess-
ments of events as they are oc-
curring is one of Taimanov's
outstanding traits — a trait to
be envied, and certainly imitated
as well. Here, White's only hope
lies in creating complications,
and Taimanov is ready to answer
13..de with 14 Qb3, giving up
his b-pawn into the bargain.
However, Gligoric not only de-
clines further acquisitions, he
even gives back his extra pawn
temporarily, securing his advan-
tage by advancing his pawns to
£5 and e5.


13% ie £6-£5
14. Ned-c5 Qd7-d5


The interesting complications
that arise after 14..Qc7 would
work out in Black's favor, but
these would be complications
nonetheless, which is precisely
what Taimanov is aiming for; so
Gligoric sticks with the strong
move 14..Qd5, centralizing his
queen. On 14..Qc7, Whit€ would
have replied 15 cd e5 16 Rcle4
17 Ne5 R:d4 18 Qb3, but Black
had a better alternative in
17..N:e5! 18 Ne6 fe 19 Ric7+

22 Qe5+ Bd6é.


15. c3:d4 e7-e5
16. Rat-cl e5:d4


Taimanov's relentless play
for complications has borne
fruit: Black plays inexactly
here. 16..e4 was correct, when
17 Ne5 would be out because a
piece would be lost, and 17 Nh4
would run into 17..Be7 18 Qh5
B:h4 19 Q:h4 Q:d4 20 Qh5 Qf6.
Now Black's extra pawn has no
great role to play, since it
is blockaded, and his isolated
pawns on the kingside are weak.

White seeks his chances pre-
cisely where they will be the
hardest to find: he can extract
nothing from the pinned knight
at c6, so he ought to have at-
tacked the £5-pawn with 18 Nh4
and 19 Qh5.

and the knight which blockaded
it has had to be replaced with
the queen.

Too bold. Taimanov should have
recalled his third move, Bb5+,
which deprived his opponent of
his lightsquare bishop, and
tried to keep the black pawns on
dark squares. For this purpose,
22 b3 was best, followed by the
transfer of his knight to c4.

This excellent move decides the


game. Black returns his extra


pawn at the best possible moment.


In a few moves, he picks up the
b-pawn, after which his two con-
nected passed pawns will bring
him victory.

Najdorf repeats the move Ko-
tov played against Gligoric in
Game 66. This time, Gligoric be-
gins immediate operations on the
queenside. As one of the spec-
tators pointed out, however, he
could have played still more
sharply: 9 Nf4, and if Blackac-
cepts the sacrifice, 10 e5 sim-
ultaneously attacks a8 and f6;
while if he does not accept, the
satGes makes a triumphal entrance
at d5.

A curious moment: in the mid-
dlegame, the rook occupies an
open line, though not a file, as
is usual; this time it's the
fourth rank, completely cleared
of both white and black pieces.
Najdorf could have prevented this
by 16..a5, but of course it never
entered his head that his oppo-
nent might intend, in the middle
game with a board full of pieces,
to open the fourth rank and oc-
cupy it with a rook.

20, Ral-a4

As he played this original move,
Gligoric offered a draw, which
Najdorf declined, although his
position gave him no grounds for
so optimistic an appraisal, as
he himself later concluded. For
example, after 20..0-0 21 Ncl
Nc5 22 Rb4! Q:a5 23 N:b3, White
has good play.

This is the sort of move that
radically alters the course of
a game, forcing the opponent to
rethink all the details of the
position. Mechanically, the move
.-g7-g5 is simple to explain:
Black exchanges off the bishop
on g3 for his knight, thereby
enhancing the prospects of his
own king*s bishop. However,
“pawns do not move backward",
and moving the pawn from g7 to
g5 defines the pawn structure
in this sector too early, making
it easier for White to formulate
a concrete plan.

the other hand, White need not
take the pawn: his best course
would be to continue 33 a4, re-
treat his bishop to £3, and
keep trying to work up counter-
threats against the black king.
In time-pressure, Petrosian
failed to notice 32..c4, and

Since White has not prevented

ploited this in the interests of
freer development: among other
things, his knight could have
gone to c6 instead of d7. Aver-
bakh opts for a solid but pas-
sive deployment, which allows
Black too few counterchances for
him to have hopes for anything
more than a draw. With 8..c5,
Black would have knocked the d-

the c-file, and cleared the e5
square for his pieces.

Black feels he has fulfilled
his primary goal in the Nimzo-

crimp on e3-e4. White begins un-
hurried preparations for the e-
pawn's advance, while Black holds
to his siege tactics: the value
of his sortie ..a7-a5-a4 is more
symbolic than real. Against this
backdrop, Black's position de-
clines noticeably over the next
ten or twelve moves: the bishop's
dithering from c8 to e6 to d7 to
c8 to e6 again does not involve
any sort of strategy, serving on-
ly to demonstrate the impregna-
bility of Black's position. Mean-
while, White marshals his forces
for the decisive stroke.

White has created a powerful

plan will be an attack on the

time for the pieces to enter
the fray: first the h-pawn must
advance, to breach the fortress
walls.


This game is vintage Reshev-
sky: instead of flinging him-
self head over heels into the
attack, he methodically accum-
ulates advantages, while trying
not to give his opponent any
counterchances. Averbakh mis-
construes the gradual develop-
ment of White's attack, taking
his caution for indecision. The
position already requires Black
to take energetic action on
the queenside.

An unpleasant weakening of

at £7, the routine attack h2-
h4-h5 would lose much of its
effectiveness, inasmuch as the
capture h5:g6 could always be
met by recapturing with the f-
pawn. 24..Bf6 was bad, of course,
since White would take the bi-
shop, bring his rook to the f-
file, and then push his pawn to
e5. And retreating the queen to
c7 would place that piece in a
most uncomfortable position.


Averbakh's only hope is to
counterattack the white center

Black is in an unenviable po-
sition, of course, but a grand-
master should not fall apart
like this, simultaneously giv-
ing up both a pawn and a key
point in his position. White
might have begun the conquest
of h6 and g7 on his 35th move
with 35 Bh6! Instead, he played
a waiting move, 35 Khl, for which
there was no particular need,
since nothing threatened the
white king where it stood. Quite
evidently Reshevsky had still
not completely made up his mind
to force through the attack.
Since matters were proceeding
through one of his accustomed
time-shortages, he wanted to
play a few nondescript moves to
reach the time control. It was
precisely these circumstances
that made it imperative for Av-
erbakh to play 35..b4, stirring
up some complications, at least.
One time-pressure possibility
might have been 36 Bho N:d3
37 B:£8 K:£8 38 Q:d3, when Black


[204]


holds things together somehow.
And if White should delay his
Bh6 long enough to play, shall
we say, 36 ab, then 36..a3 would
give Black some serious counter-
chances. After Averbakh's blun-
der, White's problem finds an
easier solution.

The various lines of this sys-
tem of development are distin-
guished chiefly by the place-
ment of the f- and a-pawns, In
Game 88, Geller played f2-f4 and
a2-a4 against Najdorf, with an
active position for White, but
somewhat insecure in the center.
In Game 36, Smyslov pushed both
pawns one square against Kotov.
In this game, Keres plays f2-
f4, but leaves the a-pawn in
place for the time being. I my-
self prefer a2-a4 and f2-f3.


Thus are the masters' tastes re-
vealed even in the opening. So
let the reader be properly skep-
tical of such notes as:"Better
a2-a4", or “f£2-f3 was more cir-
cumspect."' In the beginning of
the game, there are many roads,
and most of them lead straight
to Rome.

Contrary to the rules of po-
sitional play, here Szabo of-
fers the exchange of his good
bishop — and rightly so. In
the first place, this bishop
is living in constant fear of
White's threat to advance the
f-pawn, which means it's not so
good after all. And in the sec~
ond place, Szabo wishes to use
the rather shaky condition of
White's e-pawn to fight for the
square 45, which would make his
other bishop "good".

Keres stirs up some interest~-

for example:

Q:d5 19 Nde4;


2) 16..Ng6 17 e5 Nd7 18 N£3, or
17 B:f6 as in the first varia-
tion.


As usual, Szabo finds the most
active continuation.

We shall have occasion to
compare the relative strengths
of queen, rook and knight again


in Game 186, Kotov - Najdorf.
Knights and queens complement
each other, knights being strong
in the center and around enemy
pawns; while rooks come into
their own in the endgame, where
they find plenty of space for
their straightforward maneuvers.
Proceeding from these ideas,
White ought to utilize his
knights on the kingside, with-
out trading queens, trying for
something such as the following:
24 Qe4 QF6 25 R£1 Qg6 26 Ng5

Qc2 27 Q£3, or 24 Qg4 Qc8 25 NES
Qc3 26 N3d4.


24, ae Qd8-c8
25. Ng3-f5 Qc 8-c6
26. Qa4-d4 aac


Here too, 26 Qg4 Qf6 (26..Qg6?
27 Ne7+!) 27 Rdl was good. How-
ever, the queen exchange was most
tempting: White's knights gain
permanent sway over £5, and it
was hard to foresee that fate
would send them somewhere else
altogether.


26. aes Qc6-f6
27. Qd4:f6 g7:f6
28. a2-a4 Rb2-b4
29. a4-a5 oes


The knight's active position
on f5 might have been exploited
for an attack on f7. For this
purpose, the rook at al would
have to be brought to d7; the
loss of the a-pawn would be in-
consequential, since the b-pawn
would be recovered immediately:
29 Rd1l R:a4 30 Rd7, with the


double threat 31 Nh6+ and 31 R:b7.


White's actual move, powerful
though it might appear, leads,
amazingly enough, to a diffi-
cult endgame for him.

30. Nf5-d6 Re8-b8
31. Ral-bl R£4-a4
32. Rbi:b7 Rb8:b7
33. Nd6:b7 ace


In the middle of the board,
supported by a pawn, one knight
may sometimes be as strong as a
rook. Here, however, on the edge
of the board, the knights cannot
work at full strength, and one
rook can deal successfully with
two knights. Black's plan — to
bring up his king, drive off the
knight, or else force the trade
of both knights for his rook —


[206]


looks very dangerous indeed.
Keres' following maneuvers,
creating unbreachable defensive
positions with two knights and
a pawn, without the aid of the
king, are beautiful beyond com-
parison.

Here Black had an interesting

up the a-pawn, and the outcome
of the game would probably not
have been altered.

Typical of pawn endings. The
king, of course, is headed for

vances his king to d4 instead
of b5, then White also keeps
the option of taking the f5-
pawn first.

124. Smyslov—Euwe
(Reti Opening)

Sacrificing a pawn in order
to seize an open line in the
center is one of the oldest
strategic ideas known: it may
be found in the classical games
of Greco, Morphy, Anderssen,
Chigorin, Spielmann and Alekhine.
Occasionally, a pawn is given up
to obtain a line for a bishop,
the most obvious example being
the Danish Gambit: 1 e4 e52d4
ed 3 c3 dc 4 Bc4 cb 5 B:b2. The
most promising sacrifices, how-
ever, are those which open lines
for the rooks, especially when
this involves a direct attack on
the king. Our forebears knew of
another Muzio Gambit besides the
usual one, called the "Double
( or “Wild") Muzio": 1 e4 e5
2 £4 ef 3 N£3 25 4 Bc4 g4 5 0-0
gf 6 B:f7+ K:£7 7 Q:£3, which
is occasionally encountered
even today. Of course, masters
and grandmasters take a rather
skeptical attitude toward such
play, but it has a sizable fol-
lowing among players of middling
strength. For example, this gam-
bit was a most fearsome weapon
in the hands of a Moscow first-
category player, Volodya Smir-
nov (ihiose untimely passing we
all mourn), in school and college
tournaments, where he employed
his own analyses and variations.


But where pieces and pawns
were formerly sacrificed on the
second or third move, nowadays
such early skirmishings in the
center are avoided. It's cer-
tainly not because players fear
risk — in plain terms, the
King's Indian is a greater risk
for Black than the King's Gam-
bit for White. Nevertheless, not
one of us is afraid to play the
King's Indian, while the advo-
cates of the King's Gambit grow
fewer and fewer, as do those of
the Scotch, Italian and Vienna
Games. The problem with all these
openings is that after a short
fight in the center, the pawn
structure simplifies, and the
fight which follows becomes flat
and featureless. Players of our
day know how to sacrifice a pawn
or a piece as well as Morphy or
Anderssen did; but it is a char-
acteristic of the present state
of the art that sacrifices must
be postponed while shielding
one's combinative yearnings be-


hind a mask of positional play.


The Smyslov - Euwe game, filled
with combinative ideas that flow
organically from the position,
deserves to be counted among the
finest examples of the art of
chess.


1. Ngl-f3 Ng8-f£6
2. g2-g3 d7-d5
3. Bfi-g2 Bc8-£5
4. 0-0 Nb8-d7
5. d2-d3 c7-c6é
6. Nbi1-d2 h7-h6


With his queen's pawn supported
by 5..c6, it makes more sense to
occupy the center with 6..e5. The
problem with this move is that
his king's bishop remains shut in
behind its own pawns, making it
impossible for Black to castle
kingside for some time. Smyslov
exploits this with his 7 e4! —
somewhat later than Morphy was
accustomed to play this move, it
is true, but with no less effect.


7. e2-e4 d5:e4
8. d3:e4 Nf6:e4
9. N£3-d4 Ne4:d2


Was it the fear of giving up
his two bishops that prevented
the former World Champion from
playing 9..Nd6, and prompted him
instead to develop still another
enemy piece? After 9..Nd6 10N:f5
N:£5 11 Rel g6 12 Ne4, or 11..e6
12 Bh3 Nd6 13 Qh5, White would
still have had to prove the cor-
rectness of his pawn sacrifice.

11. Bd2-c3 eke

In the bygone days of chess,
when today's finely-tuned tech-
niques of positional play had
not yet been worked out to such
a degree, and having a piece or
a pawn more was considered the
mark of a cad — in those days,
I do not doubt that White would,
without much hesitation, have
sacrificed a knight on c6, and
knocked apart the black king's
insecure shelter. The strategic
basis for this sacrifice would
be the complete isolation of
Black's bishop and rook. Some
concrete variations:


I. 11 N:c6 be 12 B:c6 Rc8
13 Bad!


II. 12..Bf£5 13 Qf3 Rc8 14 Bad,
following which White would
place his rook on dl, obtain-
ing a position very similar to
that of the famous game Morphy —
Duke of Brunswick and Count Is-
ouard; Black has no way of free-
ing himself.


The indecisive text turns the
game in another direction for a
while, and forces Smyslov to put
forth a lot of ingenuity later
on, in order to create once again
the opportunity for a combina-
tive attack.


tf; bass Qd8-c7
12, Qd1-£3 e7-e5
13. Rfl-el 0-0-0
14. Nd4-b3 £7-£6


Euwe sets up a pawn chain on
the dark squares, without giv-
ing a thought to what will pro-
tect the light ones — a circum-
stance Smyslov later exploits
beautifully. 14..£5 should have
been played at once.

15. Be3-a5 Nd7-b6

Black overestimates his posi-
tion and plays too dogmatically,
without giving an inch. 15..b6
16 Bc3 Nc5 should have been
played. After 17 N:c5 B:c5
18 a4 Bd4 19 a5, etc., White
would have had some chances, but
the risks in that case would
have been mutual. Now, White is
home free.

White has given his opponent
a weak pawn on d5, but his plans
for the next few moves do not in-


volve an attack on it. White's
play will revolve around the


[210]


fact that the square in front

of the d-pawn has passed com-
pletely into his hands, and
makes a good base for his
pieces: from this square, pieces
could exercise strong influence
over both wings. A somewhat
vague idea, of course; one can-
not win a game, even by control-
ling the best square on the board,
without attacking anything from
it. In the present game, con-
crete targets became quite high-
ly visible after Black's ..g7-

found sufficient defensive re-
sources, one of them being his
centralized knight at e4.

White has succeeded in setting
up a strong position. He may in-
vade the king's wing with his
queen, setting up threats onthe
dark squares, or he may precede
this by cutting up the kingside
pawns with h4-h5. True, the out-
come of either course of action
is not entirely clear, but in
any event White ought not to
have submitted to the queen ex-
change he allows in a few moves.
Apparently Geller expected he
would win the ending by pure
technique, but Stahlberg puts
up his usual stubborn defense,


attaining an unbreachable po-

moves on? Behind the pawn on

has marked down as the next and

ROUND NINETEEN


127. Boleslavsky— Geller
(Sicilian Defense)


Mutual forcing attacking play
against opposite-wing castled
positions is one of the sharpest
forms of the chess struggle. In
this it is equally important not
to throw oneself too hastily in-
to the attack and not to be ex-
cessively concerned with the de-
fense of one's own king. The
harmonious blending of attack
and defense, based upon exper-
jence, knowledge and intuition,
is what we find in this game be-
tween two masters of the aggres~
sive style.

With his 6..Bg4, Geller forced
White to advance his f-pawn to
£3; making a virtue of necessity,
Boleslavsky then played the Rau~
zer Attack against his opponent's
Dragon Variation, in which White
plays f£2-£3 of his own volition.


DD eee Ra8-c8
12. Kci-bl Nc6-e5
13. h2-h4 arene





The position is of exceptional
interest, both for theory and


[213]


for the practice of the middle-
game.


White has a powerfully centra-
lized knight, making a good
counterweight to the bishop on
d7 and ready to meet a queen
sortie to a5 by retreating to
b3. White started his pawn storm
first, and has already gottenin
g3-g4 and h2-h4; his own king
position has no weaknesses, while
Black's pawn at g6 forms a hook
for White's advancing army to
seize upon.


While Black may be starting
his pawn advance later than
White's, he already has a line
open against the enemy king.

His centralized knight is very
powerful too: it attacks the
weak link in White's pawn chain—
the pawn which is, in fact, the
only support of White's whole
chain (and very shaky, too!).


Black controls, and may soon
occupy, the important square c4,
which carries about the same
value as the £5 square does for
Black; meanwhile, White still
does not control one square in
the immediate area of Black's
king. Finally, the powerful bi-
shop at g7 may give rise to dan-
gerous combinations on the long
diagonal.


As may be seen, a complex po-
sition; at the moment, it lies
in a state of dynamic equality.
Great skill is necessary in or-
der to maneuver the entire mass
of pawns and pieces, while sim-
ultaneously countering the ene-~
my's operations. In this game,
we shall follow the struggle
Move by move.

13% b7-b5

Black answers blow for blow.
This prepares ..b5~-b4, as well
as .. Nc4, after which he could
now answer B:c4 with ..b5:c4,
opening the b-file, which is
more dangerous to White than the
c-file.

14. Be3-h6é

Taking the b-pawn would be
madness, of course. And h4-h5
is ineffective, so long as
Black's pieces solidly defend
the squares h7 and h8; so first


White wants to trade off one of
the most important defensive
pieces.

14, Bg7:h6

..Bh8 is sometimes possible in
such positions: at the moment,
the rook is less valuable than
the bishop. The long diagonal,
at present loaded with pieces,
may be cleared quickly with,
for instance, 14..Bh8 15 B:f8
R:c3 16 be N:f3 17 N:f3 Nie4 —
not a forced line by any means,
and a clear loss for Blackhere
as well, but presented merely
as an illustration of the ideas
that may come up in the course
of battle.

15. Qd2:h6 Rc8:c3

h4-h5 was a real threat now,
so this exchange of rook for

the king's cover, was practic-
ally forced.

As Boleslavsky explained it la-
ter, he of course saw that the
black knight could take the f-
pawn, followed by the rook check
at c3, forking king and knight;
but he thought his 26 Rd3 would
protect both attacked pieces —
including the king!

No rook can fight a bishop and

the a-pawn, perhaps White might
scare up some sort of chances,
but it will take him a couple of

that time, the black pawns can

Making a draw with Black some-
times becomes a necessity due to

approach of more important games.
When he needed to draw a game,
Smyslov used the Slav Defense,
and neither Boleslavsky, nor Sza-
bo, nor Stahlberg in this game


(215)


could make any headway against
it.


True, Szabo found the inter-
esting move 11 Bd3, and obtained
a significant advantage after
11..Qa5?, but two rounds later
Smyslov already had an improve-
ment for Black, 11..h6; and his
subsequent maneuver ..Nd7-b8-

Every positional achievement —
in this case, the pawn at d6,
which commands the attention of
the black pieces — is important,
but not so much of itself as in
conjunction with other combina-
tive or positional motifs. In
the diagrammed position, the mo-
tifs for White are:


1) the undefended c5-pawn,


2) the Black king's weakened
cover,


3) the ever-present possibil-
ity of the advance d6-d7,


4) control of the c7 and e7
squares; coupled with this,
the idea of trying for control
of either the c-file or the e-
file.


And for Black:


1) the possibility of surround-
ing the d-pawn from three sides,


2) a queenside majority attack,


3) the possibility of ..Nh5,
which would force White's queen
away from its strong position
on £4.


It is by means of this match-
ing up and balancing of the
chances for both sides that the
master generally arrives at more
or less objective conclusions,
which are called an “evaluation
of the position".


{217]


If coefficients could be found
for that sort of evaluation, then
machines could also play chess.


By now it is clear that White,
whose pieces are more actively
placed, should try to exploit
his opponent's weaknesses, while
not forgetting his main threats.
There were two ways for Euwe to
accomplish this. One was 22 b3,
in order to slow Black's pawn
roller: ..b5-b4, ..c5-c4 and
..c4=-c3; but Black's position
would still have been difficult
to crack, chiefly due to the
bishop at e6. So 22 R:e6 sug-
gests itself, in order to elim-
inate the only black piece that
has any freedom of action, and
thus fling open the door to the
black king's shelter along the
seventh rank, while turning
Black's three good pawns at f7,
g6 and h6 into two weak ones at
e6 and g6. White's attack could
then develop as follows: 22..fe
23 Qe5 Qd7 24 Bh3, or 23..Re8
24 Q:c5.


At all events, the text move
had little to recommend it. It
does nothing to further White's
plans, and needlessly weakens
b3. Keres exploits this skill-
fully.

22. bide R£8-e8

An excellent defensive maneu-
ver. The bishop threatens to
exit to b3, when the rook at dl
will be overburdened, having to
defend the d-pawn as well as
the king's rook.

Black prepares to castle. Con-

this or some other weakening was
practically unavoidable, and it
is hard to say whether Reshevsky
would have had less of a problem
after 9..h6. Szabo would then
have tried to have his king's
bishop and his queen trade
places as quickly as possible,
and what would Black do then?
Further weakening of his pawn
barricade with ..g7-g6 or ..f7-
£5 would be fatal, and Black
obviously would not have enough
time to bring his knight to £6.
On the other hand, that same
..N£8 would be not only his one
chance, but his one hope as
well. So we must conclude that
the combination of 6..Nc6 with
7..Ni:c3 was unfortunate. The
text move weakens a whole clus-
ter of squares, and gives White
the basis for a successful at-
tack.

White's position was so pow-
erful that despite his unbeliev-

he still has more than enough
to win here. Once again, it
comes down to a mate threat at
g7, for which purpose he need
only have retreated his bishop
by 27 Bh6. The only reply would
be 27..£6, when 28 Qg3 would
have won at least a rook.


Szabo played otherwise:

This move is not obligatory
either, but a lot of people seem
to think that in the King's In-

quickly as possible. I don't be-

.-£7-£5 or ..f£7-£5-f£4 attack is
good, provided it achieves some
substantive end; if not, then
it's better to postpone ..f7-f£5
until it is most effective. For
this reason, 7..Nbd7 and 7..a5
were not at all inferior to the

During the past fifteen
moves Black has tried by every
means available to complicate
the game, but Petrosian's sol-
id preventive measures have
taken their toll: Gligoric loses
faith, and just at the very mo-
ment when blind luck offers him
an unexpected — I might even
say unbelievable — opportunity
to complicate, and mix things
up. The idea of giving a rook
for "only" two pawns with


37..R:e4 seemed just too risky.
But when one sacrifices, one
does not count pawns, but rather
accrued advantages and concrete
variations.


Had Gligoric not lost heart,
and found within himself the
strength to sacrifice the rook,
the continuation might have
been very interesting; I am
sure that Petrosian would have
had reason to regret his care-
lessness.


First, some considerations
of a general nature. After 38 fe
N:e4, the only White reply that
makes any sense is 39 Qel, de-
fending against the newly cre-
ated threat of 39..Nd2+ 40 Kal
R:a2+ 41 K:a2 Qa8 mate. Nor is
this all: Black's queen now takes
on d5, and White's king is quite
suddenly and quite obviously in
a mating net.


For just one rook (of question-
able usefulness), Black clears
away all pawn obstructions in
the center; along with the three
pawns he gets as material com-
pensation, he also obtains two
diagonals, one file and a power-
ful knight in the very middle of
the board. White's material ad-
vantage would probably have al-
lowed him to save his king from
direct threats, but finding the
solution to this task would have
presented him no small difficul-
ties.


For those who enjoy compli-
cated, pretty variations, we
present a summary analysis,
giving a good illustration of
the possibilities for both
sides in this head-breaking
position. (In addition to the
author's variations, we have
made use here of those arising
from the correspondence pole-~
mic between Soviet grandmaster
Tigran Petrosian and the Yugo-
slav master Vukovic, commenta-
tor for "Sahovski Glasnik".

Of course Gligoric could not
calculate all of these varia-
tions through in time-pressure,
and therefore was unable to bring
himself to give up a rook on
"spec". On the other hand, con-
sidering that Black ended up re-
signing the game four moves la-
ter, the rook doesn't appear to
have been worth keeping.


38. Ne2-c3 Ra4-d4
39. b2-b3 si


Whether by intuition or by
conscious choice, Petrosian is
not about to allow Black to play
something as tempting as ..R:e4
twice. In the game of chess as
in life, opportunity knocks but
once.

ROUND TWENTY


134. Taimanov—Petrosian
(Nimzoindian Defense)


One of the tournament's most
beautiful games, in which White,
without resorting to a pawn
storm, managed to break down a
solid defensive position by com-
binative means.


The reader will note that this
is not the first time we have re-
ferred to a game as being "one
of the most beautiful of the
tournament". Indeed, a great num-
ber of beautiful games were pro-
duced here. True beauty in chess
can only be a creation by both
players: should one player's mas-
tery of the game considerably ex-
ceed that of his opponent, the
resulting creation cannot afford
us complete esthetic satisfac-
tion.


There were only three brilli-
ancy prizes given at the Zurich
tournament; but even if there
had been ten times that many,
the jury could still have found
worthy recipients for them.

A defensive system that saw a
lot of use in this event — in
Games 12, 71, 102 and 160, for
example. In each case, Black
found sufficient counterchances,
thanks to his extra queenside
pawn.


In this game, Taimanov spends
two moves in order to trade off
the black queen's knight, which
enables himtocarry out his in-
tended f£2-£3 and e3-e4 quickly,
by eliminating the pressure on
the d4-pawn.

White able to get in e3-e4 so
quickly and effectively, open-
ing diagonals for both his bi-
shops at once. The slightest
misstep from Black could result
in his king's falling under a
powerful attack — Qh4 is already
threatened.

Petrosian decides to turn to
defense exclusively, based upon
the strong point at e6. This de-
cision was not at all forced: us-
ing his temporary lead in devel-
opment and the central pawn ten-
sion, he might have stirred up
sharp play by means of 15..f5.


For example:


I. 16 ed Q:d5 17 Be3 NeS5 —
17..f4and 17..cd are good too.


II. On 16 e5, Black has kept
the c4 square open for his
knight, and would reply 16..b5,
with the threat of ..Nd7=b6-c4,


III. Perhaps Petrosian disliked
the continuation 16 c4 fel7 fe
dc 18 d5, but this is not dan-

gerous for Black either, after

18..Qd6:


a) 19 B:c4 Ne5 20 Be2 ae
21 Bb2 B:e2 22 Q:e2 Rae8, and
the white pawns are blockaded};


b) 19 de Q:d3 20 ed R:f1+
21 Q:£1 Qd4+;


c) Black would get a tremen-
dous attack after 19 R:f8+
R:£8 20 de Ne5, when the bi-


shop cannot retreat to bi or
e2 because of 21..Qd4+, while
if it retreats to fi or c2,
then 21..Ng4, and I see no
way of stopping both 22..Q:h2
mate and 22..Qd4+.

White has a clear plan of at-
tack: h3, Kh2, Rgi, g4, Qg3 or
Qh4, and Black cannot meet this
on the kingside in any way. Pe-
trosian's attempt to divert his
opponent with his extra queen-
side pawn is understandable, but
now a breach appears in his for-
tress, through which the enemy
bishops will assail Black's po-
sition from the flank, while the


queen and the other rook contin-


ue their frontal assault.

The starting point for much
theoretical research. Latest
analyses give White the nod,
perhaps without sufficient
grounds for doing so. The point
of Black's defense 7..a6 and
8..Bd7 is that with the white
queen on d2 and bishop on g5,
Black always has the stroke
..N:e4 available.


9. £2-£4 eee


It is difficult to get any

excellent endgame. Retreating

the queen to el opened up new

possibilities for further cre-
ativity on both sides.

Qd8-a5


In days of yore, people were
not as preoccupied with pawns
as they are today, counting
them up after every half-move —
no, pawns used to be sacrificed
at the drop of a hat for var-
ious, occasionally questionable
and even dubious ends. Eventhen,
however, they were not given
away. Steinitz, for example,
used to suffer an awful lot for
the chance to hang onto, and
then bring home, one extra pawn.
He probably would not have parted
quite so lightly with his d-
pawn; on the other hand, one
may sympathize with Averbakh's
distaste for 12..Qc7, since af-
ter 13 B:f6 gf 14 Nd5, the queen
has to lose a tempo and retreat
to d8: a prospect unlikely to
appeal to anyone. However, posi-
tions do occur whose solution
lies precisely in such a modus
operandi — could this be one
such? At any rate, after 14..Qd8
I see no immediate dangers for
Black, and perhaps he will be
able to rid himself of the e-
file pin with the curious move
..Nc6-e5!


13. N£5:d6+  B£8:d6

The game immediately loses all
interest for theory and goes in-
to the trenches for a war of ma-
neuver, where neither side wants
to undertake any active plan.


15 B:f6 gf 16 Qh4 is very in-
teresting here, but I believe
the strongest course would be
the simple retreat of the rook
from d6 to d2. Only after see-
ing Black's reply should White
decide whether he will play on
the black pawn weaknesses after
B:£6 or keep this bishop for an
attack on the squares round ab-
out the black king. Lately this
variation has become the rage.

this occasionally gives his

this game is shortly drawn.

tage after 8..ed 9 de B:c5 10 a3

137. Reshevsky—Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense)


In Game 17 against Averbakh,
Reshevsky was unable to solve


[227]


his defensive problems in the
opening; so he decided to employ
a similar system here as White.
He had to wait quite a while —
from the third to the twen-
tieth round — since no one
wanted to play the main-line
Nimzo-Indian against him.

Reshevsky played 11..Rd8 against
Averbakh, in order to prevent 12d5,
but Euwe does not consider this
push to be dangerous, and he may
be right.

12. d4-d5 e5-e4

Euwe had an energetic counter-
blow ready, but there was no
need for it. Simply moving the
knight to a5 would have left the
d5-pawn in a precarious position,
cut off from its own camp. For
example, 12..Na5 13 d6 Qc6 14N:e5
Qe4 recovers the pawn with good
play. Also possible is Euwe's
postmortem suggestion of 13..Qb6
14 N:e5 Nic4 15 N:c4 Qaé.


13. d5:c6 e4:£3
14. Qd1i:£f3 Be8-g4
15. Qf3-g3 Qc7:c6


White holds his usual small
positional advantage in this
variation: a kingside pawn maj-
ority, which can drive the black
knight from f6, after which the
bishop-pair will have attacking
prospects against the king. As
for Black's extra pawn on the
queenside, that must wait for
an endgame.


16. e3-e4 Bg4-h5

Euwe resolutely undertook the
maneuver ..Bg4-h5-g6 in order to
cover his king, anticipating the
coming attack; but then he failed
to carry it through, beginning
another plan instead: ..a7-a6
and ..b7-b5. The bishop, left


[228]


untended, allows White the
opportunity for an interesting
maneuver of his own. Better to
complete one plan (by playing
..Bg6 now or after ..Nc7) be-
fore beginning another.

Not everyone would decide to
take such a pawn: after 22..c4,
23..Nd5 is threatened, or
23..Ra8, and the bishop might
disappear in a wink. But Resh-
evsky is prepared, if he sees
a chance to win, to think it
over for two hours and twenty-
five minutes, if it means he
will then be able to exploit
that chance and fashion a win
out of it.

Now the game enters a new
phase, wherein Black, despite
his pawn minus, has fair draw-
ing chances, especially if the
queens are exchanged. The prob-
lem for White is that he only
has one bishop now, and that one


not the better of the two,

since his pawns stand on dark
squares; additionally, White
has a weak pawn at c3, and Black
has the more active rook.


White, in turn, can prepare
and carry out a maneuver to ex-
tend his bishop's diagonal:
pushing his e-pawn to e6 when
the time is right. This advance
will be even stronger if the f-
pawn gets to £5 first.


These are the underlying mo-
tifs of the struggle that fol-
lows.

task is much simplified.

This destroys the fruits of

37 Bb4 Rail+ 38 Kg2 Nd5, which

The exchange of bishops and
knights has simplified Black's
position; now, by preparing
..c6-c5, he wishes to solve
Black's basic problem in the
Orthodox Defense: the develop-
ment of his queen's bishop.
White has several different ways
to proceed here. One good line
involves placing his rook onel,
and pushing his e-pawn to e4,
meeting ..c5 with d4-d5. He
may also retreat the bishop to
a2, and bring his rooks to the
c-file. Keres likes to set his
knights in central positions,
and occasionally succeeds with
an attack based on such favorable
placement.


Exchanging knights at e5 might
tempt Black — in fact, if all
the pieces could be cleared from
the board then, the pawn ending
would be much superior for him,
perhaps even a win, thanks to
his three-to-two on the queen-
side. However, no one has yet
found the way to remove all the
pieces. After 14..N:e5 15 de
Bb7 16 Rd6, White occupies d6
and the rest of the file aswell.
The exchange of rooks could only
take place on d6 after that,
and White would recapture with
his pawn, obtaining a powerful
passed pawn.


So Black develops his bishop
first, which creates a threat to
trade knights, since after
14..Bb7 15 Ba2 N:e5 16 de Rad8!,
for instance, the d-file would
become a trading-ground.


14. oe Bc8-b7
15. £2-f4 Nd7:e5
16. f£4:e5 c6-c5


Certainly the opening has been
a success for Black: having se-
cured full equality, he now en-
ters an engrossing full-scale
battle, despite the rather slim
material available. He has two
open files at his disposal (c-
and d-), while White has only
one (the f-).


Open files are important when
they contain targets, or when
they serve as avenues of commu-
nication for the transfer of
pieces, usually rooks, to the
main theater of action. In this
case, the f-file satisfies both
conditions; more importantly,
however, it lies close to the
king, which makes Stahlberg ner-
vous.


The Swedish grandmaster de-
cides to swing his bishop over
to the defense of the king's
wing via e4, and thereafter to
concentrate on his attack against
the d-pawn and on using the c-
file for flanking maneuvers
against the white king. Such a
plan is certainly feasible, but
I do think Black would have ob-
tained more from the position if
he had exchanged on d4 immediate-
ly, and then tried to invade the
second rank with his rooks. His
threats against g2 might have
curtailed the activities of the
white rooks.

Naturally, it would have made
no sense for Black to trade
off his bishop with 21..Bh5
22 Q:h5 R:c4, since that piece
traveled here for the express
purpose of protecting his king.
After 23 Rd3, White's attack
gets there first.

Such moves can and should only
be played when there is no long-
er any other way to defend the
king. Here Black had wholly suf-

lent — means: 22..Rec8 23 Bao

h6, g5 and f6.

Now the forcing play begins:

Keres rushes to crown his

doing, he gives his opponent

correct, nailing the kingside
down, after which there would
no longer be a defense to the
threat of 30 Qf4 and 31 d5!

Psychologically speaking, one
can understand why Black should
seize the first opportunity to
exchange queens and rid himself
of White's mating threats, but
the resulting endgame is hope-
less for him. 31..£5 instead
would have given him good draw-
ing chances.


In order to keep his attack
from flickering out, Keres would
probably have sacrificed a rook
at £5, but after 32 Rf:f5 gf

appears to have no better move

An unusual system against the

to give Black the slightest
chance of obtaining an initia-
tive. White firmly anchors his
d4-pawn, and controls e5 three
times, preventing Black from
carrying out the traditional
King’s Indian advance, ..e/7-e5.
5 h3 is thrown in to safeguard
the queen's bishop against pos-
sible exchange via ..Nh5.


In this game, Boleslavsky dem-
onstrates the best method of com-
bating this solid, although ra-
ther indolent, system: he plays
-.c7-c5, occupies the c-file, and
builds a barricade of pawns be-

other course would have left

tinuation here, intending e3-e4.


13. siete Nc6:e5
14. d4:e5 Qc7:e5
15. e3-e4 sone


A sharp and original idea: ex-
ploiting the bishop's temporary
position at g4 to push his pawn
to e4 without the support of his
minor pieces. White could right-
fully lay claim to a strategic
victory — if he could also se-
cure the advance of his f-pawn
two squares. However, since he
has to keep f£2-f3 in reserve in
order to prevent Black from pick-
ing off the e-pawn, White's only
pawn in the center will be pretty
shaky. This shows, for instance,
in the fact that White cannot re-


ply to Black's next move, 15..Rfe8,


with the natural 16 Rel in view
of 16..N:e4! 17 £3 Q:c3 18 Qic3

21 K£2 Re2+ 22 Kf£3 R:a2. In this
line, 20..N:a2, recommended by

since White, instead of taking

the knight remains trapped.

While White has spent his time
maneuvering bishops, Black has
brought his knight to a strong
position. The laws of chess allow
that it may be driven off with
a pawn move, but the laws of
strategy categorically forbid
such a move as 21 g3, since this
would fatally weaken the second
rank. Thus, White should have
begun thinking about maintaining
equality here by playing 21 Bci
since, to White's great good for-
tune, 21..Bb5 still does not
work.


Geller is unwilling to believe
that he does not have the better
game, and so he seeks to gain
the upper hand on the d-file,
which allows Kotov to carry out
a beautiful combination on the
themes of deflection of the
queen and cooperation of queen
and knight. We have already men-
tioned that queen and knight can
sometimes be stronger than queen
and bishop, and occasionally they
are no weaker than queen and rook.
This will be easier to comprehend
if one bears in mind that the bi-
shop's capabilities parallel
the queen's, while the knight's
complement them.

Black has resolved all of his
opening problems well; the only
thing left to do now is develop
his queen's knight so that he
can get into the fight for the
c- and d-files. Desiring compli-
cations, White plays the double-
edged 15 b4&, with the idea of
getting his knight to c5; how-
ever, this allows Black the op-
portunity to invade at c4. Play
now revolves around the follow-
ing themes: the control and oc-
cupation of c4 and c5, the op-
position of the bishops on the
long diagonal, and the control
of the open files.

Is it possible that Smyslov

closes up the center with 13d5,
leaving the bishop nothing bet-
ter to do than return to c8. Af-
ter 12..Re8 13 de de is possi-
ble, when the black rook even-
tually goes to the d-file. But
after this move it would make
no sense at all for White to
play either 13 d5 (while the
bishop still stands on c8) or
13 de (since the rook is already
on the d-file). So instead White
continues the traditional knight's
tour, from bi via d2 and flto g3


or e3.

And here is the novelty Keres
prepared. The position this cre-
ates cannot be exhaustively an-
alyzed, since every move gives
rise to three or four different
possibilities, none worse than
any other. So a calculation five
moves deep would entail checking
out around twenty thousand var-
lations, stopping periodically
along the way to decide whether
this or that intermediate posi-
tion would favor one side or the
other. Such a calculation could
probably be performed only by a
computer — but a computer does
not possess intuition.


If we try to evaluate the po-
sition on the basis of general
principles, we conclude that
White has good attacking chances:
both his bishops, both his
knights, and his queen can be
mobilized quickly to the battle-
field, while the rook hinders
the black king's flight. There
are only two tactical counter-
chances for Black that we can
see: his queen attacks the bishop
on c2, and his rook may even-
tually threaten the white queen.


Therefore, there has to be a
line White can play that will
give these possibilities con-
crete expression. In that case,
why does 12..Rd8, and the whole
variation, deserve an exclama-
tion mark? It's for Keres' as-
tute psychological preparations.
Knowing beforehand what line


[235]


was to be played, he set Bole-
slavsky the sort of problem that
would be very difficult to solve
over the board. Under these cir-
cumstances, Keres ran no great
risk of losing, while his win-
ning chances were very good in-
deed.

Many commentators thought this
move a waste of time, and recom-
mended 18 Nf£5 instead; but after
18..Bb4 it is not clear just
how White is to continue the at-
tack, not just for the sake of
attacking, but in order to win.
There was a loss of time, true,
but not here; 16 Qe2, as played,
instead of the correct 16 Ng5.


18. a3 g7-g6

Simple and good. White threat-
ened to bring in his knights at
£5 or h5, and then to reinforce
them with the queen. By this one
modest move, Keres immediately
solves several defensive prob-
lems by depriving White's pieces
of the £5 and h5 squares. Bear
in mind that White's advantage
is of a temporary sort, and that
if it is not put into some con-
crete form within the next two
or three moves, Black will bring
up his reserve (the knight on
a5) to solidify his king's posi-
tion. After Black's powerful
move, I don't believe Boleslav-
sky had any way to continue his
attack other than 19 Ndf5! If
Black takes the knight, he:


1) opens the g-file,
2) opens the bi-h7 diagonal,


3) lets the queen get to h5,
and most importantly,


4) must tolerate a white knight
at £5 anyway!


If Black could defend himself
successfully in this line, then
already there was nothing to be
done for White! But in that case
Keres would also have had no
easy time of it, whereas here
White's game worsens move by
move.

143. Stahiberg—Reshevsky
(King’s Indian)


Even among the strongest of
the contemporary masters, we still
find the sort of player who is
far stronger with the white
pieces than with the black. With
Black, such a player thinks
about getting a draw from the
opening moves. When he has
White, certain positions inspire
in him flights of fancy, and a
desire to win at any cost; when
he has Black, the same positions
seem to inspire nothing but bore-
dom, and calculations aimed at
"equalizing". This quality is
a strong characteristic in
Reshevsky, which the reader will
note for himself from a study of
his games. I will mention only
this statistic: in this tourna-
ment, Reshevsky won seven games
with White, lost only one and
drew six; while with Black, he
could only win one, losing three
and drawing ten!


In the present game Reshevsky


[236]


played dull chess, not even at~
tempting to make use of the
counterchances inherent in the
King's Indian Defense.

Of course Black will not take

The invasion at c2 with the
knight was thoughtless, of course.
Time-pressure was not a factor
yet, and there was no reason for
me to suppose that Euwe had de-
cided to hand me the game with
his 27 £3. Indeed, after 27..Nc2
28 Re2 is bad because of 28..Rd1+;
consequently, I should have giv-
en more thought to 28 Rel. In-
stead, I glanced over two varia-
tions: 28 Rc1 Rd2 29 fe fe, and
28 Rel e3 29 R:c2 Rdi+ 30 Kg2
Rd2+. Both seemed to have their
good points, and so I decided to
postpone the final decision un-
til after White's reply.


The choice, however, turned
out to be a difficult one. In
the first line, after 30 Rdl!,
White gets the better endgame;
in the second line, after 31 R:d2
ed, the d-pawn never queens at
all, as Black hoped, in view of
the simple 32 £4, when White
still has his bishop, while
Black no longer has his knight.
So 28..Nb4 would probably have
been correct, but after that it
would have been White's turn to
assume the offensive. Quite ev-
idently, Euwe was feeling peace-
able that day. All's well that
ends well.

145. Szabo—Gligoric
(English Opening)

Saying something like " the
contemporary way of handling the
opening" still does not explain
how the opening was played. Some-
times, the opening is sharp, and
the first mistake decides the
outcome. In this case, both sides
reveal their plans at the outset:
one attacks, let's say, on the
kingside, while the other does
the same on the queenside. This
has always been one of the most
popular scenarios, in our day
as much as it was in the past.


In the present game, we meet
a new approach, one which has
begun appearing relatively re-
cently in tournaments, and which
Konstantinopolsky aptly termed
“the clash of openings’. Both
sides bring their troops out


according to a chosen scheme,
making no contact with the op-
position for the moment, and
in most cases not crossing the
demarcation line between the
fourth and fifth ranks.


Such an unhurried attitude,
however, frequently foreshadows
an interesting game — as it
does here.

A position has been reached
which is reminiscent of aClosed
Sicilian, with the only differ-
ence being that the pawn on c2
has jumped to c4. White's pawns
occupy good starting positions
for a strong attack on the king.
As soon as Szabo plays his 12 fs,
Black plays his 12..b5, and —
they're off!

On d4 this knight would have
blockaded the base of the white
pawn chain and controlled more
important squares than it does
here. Among other things, it
would have made White's next
move impossible, and forced Sza-
bo to decide what he wants todo
with his f-pawn.

difficulty as being similar to
one that occurred in a game
Milner-Barry - Capablanca. In
a similar position, Black re-
captured on g7, but some Moscow
players later showed that --Re8

that would have been the better

White can now strike a posi-

c-file, the two bishops, and an
extra pawn on the queenside;
Black has a strongly centralized
knight and an extra pawn on the
kingside. White will have the
easier time trying to turn his
advantages to account, if only
because, in such positions:


1) the two bishops can do more
than bishop and knight, even
when the knight is centralized:


2) White's passed pawn on the
a- or b-file will be more dan-


gerous than Black's, since the
latter can easily be stopped
by the white king;


3) the relative weakness of
Black's a- and d-pawns will
be of no small significance.

ROUND TWENTY-TWO


148. Najdorf—Averbakh
(Queen's Indian Defense)


Middlegame and endgame cannot
be separated, one from the other;
in the middlegame — and some-
times even in the opening — the
master discerns the outlines of
the forthcoming endgame. Many of
Averbakh's creations are very
logical and consistent because
he is such a great authority on,
and enthusiast of, the endgame.
Here, by moves 12-15 he had al-
ready visualized the coming
knight vs. bishop endgame, and
did everything possible there-
after to assure his knight the
best possible working conditions
for its struggle against the bi-
shop. We know the knight is
strong: a) when the pawns are
fixed, b) when it has points of
support, and c) when the enemy
pawns are on squares of the same
color as his bishop.


Averbakh achieves all of this
by means of some fine maneuvers,
leaving Najdorf in complete zug-
zwang.

It has been said that this
move weakened the c4-pawn, and
that therefore the usual 9 Q:c3
was better. I do not think that
such a weakening would have had
very much of an effect on the
overall pawn mass, had White only
taken the status of this pawn
(at c4) into account when making
his further plans, and not al-
lowed Black to attack it unim-
peded. Black's knight will now
try to get to a5 via c6, which
White should endeavor to meet by
the timely posting of his knight
to b3. Play could proceed approx-
imately as follows: 9..Nc6 10 Nd2
Nad 11 B:b7 N:b7 12 Nb3. White
now plans an immediate advance
of his a-pawn to a4 and a5, thus
forcing Black to play ..a7-a5
himself, which deprives his knight
of that square. Should the knight
then try for d6é, it would be met

by the very pawn it was tryin.

Of course, this position is
far less appealing for White
than the one obtained in the
preceding variation. The role
of pawn-keeper is hardly a be-
coming one for the queen, and
queens may also be exchanged..

White has an unenviable posi-
tion — but why?


1) Above all, because his a2-
and c3-pawns are clearly weak-
er than their opposite numbers
at a6 and b6; the c-pawn espec-
ially needs constant defense;


2) White's position contains a
gaping hole at c4, which Black
will find perfectly fitted to

his knight, and perhaps to his
rook as well;


3) the darksquare bishop is
passively placed — compare it
with Black's!


31. Bei-f2 are


Hoping that Black will go af-
ter the pawn with 31..Rb2 32 Rcl,
but Averbakh simply brings up
his king.








White's only chance is an at-
tack on the weak pawn at b6, but
this is illusory, since it can
always advance to b5, and the
knight on c4 protects it anyway.


Of course, Black cannot hold
on to all the advantages his po-
sition contains, but he doesn't
need them all in order to win.
Shortly White eliminates his
weakness at c3, but only by en-
tering precisely the sort of
endgame Averbakh has been striv-
ing for. A more solid position
would be obtained by 21 Nd3 Nc4
22 Rfci Rc6 23 Kfl.

An unusual and rarely-seen
system, the so-called "Double
Stonewall", which once enjoyed
great popularity. The blocked
state of the center pawns en-
forces a complex maneuvering
game, which gains a measure of
sharpness from the positions
of the knights at e4 and e5
and the possibility (never ac-
tually carried out in this game)
of a sudden g2-g4 or ..g7-g5.
The position is not wholly sym-
metrical: White's pawn at c4
gives him some queenside initia-
tive, so Black usually builds on
the kingside. Both sides have
"bad" queen's bishops, and would
be happy to trade them off, even
if "only" for knights, or grad-
ually bring them into play on
the kingside. These basic motifs
underlie the play for the next
8-10 moves.


8. ees b7-b6
9. Bcei-d2 Bc 8-a6


This move would have had some
point, if Black could have traded
off the lightsquare bishops, but
it quickly becomes clear that he
cannot exchange on c4 without
giving up the center.


10. Qd1-e2 eee


Since 10..B:c4 11 B:c4 de
12 Q:c4 would leave serious weak-
nesses at e6 and c6, the bishop
goes right back to b/7.


10. deere Ba6-b7
11. c4:d5 Boake


In many such positions it suits
White to trade on d5 when Black
cannot recapture with the e-pawn.
Such a moment occurs now, and
Taimanov seizes the c-file.

This trade is more or less
forced, as otherwise it would
be difficult for Black to com-
plete the development of his
queenside. On 15..Nd7 there
could follow 16 Nc6 B:c6 17 R:cé6,
hitting the bishop at d6 and
threatening the a-pawn, as well
as 18 Racl, sealing his control
of the open file.


16. £4:e5 Bb7-c6
17. Na4-b2 ose


Not a proper place for the
knight. It should have returned
to c3, and traded off the knight
on e4 at the earliest convenient
moment.

Szabo wishes to free himself
from the coils of the positional
squeeze that now menaces him. If
19 B:a6, then 19..Qg5 threatens
20..Bh5 or 20..N:d2; also, when
the bishop leaves a6, Black's
rook will be able to invade at
a3. So Taimanov declines the
pawn.


19. a2-a4 Qd8-g5
20. Rai-f1 oe


So the rook ought not to have
left here at move 12. In any
event, Taimanov is now even with

and 10..Bb7).

Szabo cleverly continues his


search for the initiative, once
more offering a pawn: 21 ab ab
22 B:b5 Ra3!, with good chances;
for example: 23 Bd3 Bh5 24 Qel
Rfa8.


Thus, a not overly prolonged
maneuvering stage is followed
by a period during which combin-
ative motifs appear more and more
frequently.

Black's active play has reaped
some not inconsiderable position-
al fruits: his “inferior' light-
square bishop is better devel-
oped than the enemy's passive
darksquare bishop, he has wrested
control of the c-file away, and
the threatened Nc5 is not danger-

Black has completed his re-
grouping and now stands better:
he attacks the b-pawn, and con-
trols the c-file, and his queen
is active too. All that saves
White is the fact that the bishop
is somewhat insecure at £5, since
White's next move sets up a
threat of 37 N:d5 followed by
38 Q:f5.


36. Qb2-£2


Now White wins a pawn by the
threat of 37 N:e6, but remains
with the inferior position. When

shall explain why this is so.

41. 263 Qe5-g6


Black refrains from advancing
his e-pawn for the moment, so
as not to give White's queen
access to the kingside.


Now he threatens ..N:b4, ..Rce2,
and ..e4-e3, in this or some
other order. The strength of
Black's position is that his
pieces stand ready to attack
the king, and his pawn at e4
is worth a piece. White's pawn,
by contrast, can only advance:
it supports nothing, and needs
protection itself as well.


These are all general ideas,
however; the actual play here-
abouts requires great accuracy
and farseeing calculation. The
next few moves by both sides
are the best possible — from
the viewpoint of the respective
opponents — since the game was
adjourned at this point, and
resumed after painstaking ana-
lysis.


42. e5-e6 Nc6:b4

This is stronger than 43 Qd7,
when there would follow 43..e3,
and if 44 B:e3 Qe4, or if 44 Bg3
e2 45 Rei Qg4. In both these
lines Black wins, as has been
demonstrated by detailed analy-
sis, whose variations run to
the 53rd move; we shall present
only one of them: 44 Bg3 e2
45 Rel Qg4 46 Qf7 Q:d4+ 47 Khi


Qd5 48 R:e2 Rce2 49 Qf1 Qd3 50 Rel

48. Qd6-d7 Sete


After analyzing the adjourned
position, Taimanov ought to have
realized the seriousness of
Black's counterchances and made
some attempt at reaching a peace-
able conclusion. Now was pre-
cisely the right time: 48 e8Q!
Q:e8 49 R:d3 e1Q+ 50 B:zel Q:el+
51 Kh2 is a forced draw. The
text move not only fails to im-

150. Gligoric—Euwe
(Nimzoindian Defense)

"The basic position of the Nim-
zo-Indian" (after 1 d4 Nf6 2c4
e6 3 Nc3 Bb4 4 e3 cS 5 Bd3 d5
6 N£3 Nc6 7 0-0 0-0) occurred
eleven times in this tournament
prior to this twenty-second
round; of those games, six were
drawn, with the results of the
remaining five favoring Black
slightly.


You will not find Gligoric's
name Listed among those who are
considered "main-line enthusi-
asts"; those would be Reshevsky,
Euwe and Averbakh. For this game
Gligoric came as close to the
main line as he ever did
in the course of the tournament,
but he gave it a different treat-
ment, more like a Queen's Gam-
bit: developing the bishop ate2,
he traded off the center pawns
so as to leave Black an isolated
d5-pawn. The game's chief int-
erest lies in the ebb and flow
of the positional struggle that
revolves around this pawn.


Heavy-piece fighting for an
isolated pawn is one of the cen-
tral elements of positional play.
Much more is involved than the
simple formula:"White attacks
twice, Black defends twice — and
a draw is the outcome". Woven
into the struggle are such mo-
tifs as: pinning the isolated
pawn (should the heavy pieces
defend it from behind), a sud-
den switch to an attack on the
king, or an attempt to occupy
the seventh rank at some point
when the heavy pieces are tied
to the defense of the isolated
pawn. Isolated pawn endings were
played with great skill by the
classicists Lasker, Capablanca
and Rubinstein. In the present
game, Gligoric and Euwe come
forearmed with their knowledge
of the old masters' legacy.

The reader who immerses himself

in this battle's fine points, who
examines the techniques used here,
and who familiarizes himself with
the basic ideas behind this type

of ending, will have made a great
stride forward in positional play.


The game's concluding phase, a


"four-vs-three" rook endgame, is


also of great theoretical inter-
est.

It is Black's task to rid him-
self of the isolated pawn — that
is, to push it to d4 and trade it
off. This, however, is impossible
for the moment, due to 11 Na4.
The natural thing for Black to
do would therefore be to prepare
this advance with ..a7-a6 and
..Ba7. It is White's task to
use these two tempi to bring out
another piece to control the d4
square, intending to occupy it
later on with a knight. Follow-
ing this plan, one must consider
10 b3! a6 11 Na4 Ba7 12 Bb2 more
logical; if then 12..b5 13 Rcl!,
followed by 14 Nc5. The square
d4 would have remained under
White's control, a strategic
accomplishment of no small im-
portance.


10. eee a7-aoé
11. b2-b4 Bc5-d6
In his detailed comments to


this game for a Yugoslav maga-
zine, Gligoric's second, Tri-
funovic, indicates that 11..Ba7
should have been played here: on
12 Bb2, Black could have contin-
ued 12..d4; and on 12 b5 (after
11..Ba7), Trifunovic gives a
pretty variation: 12..d4 13 be
de 14 Qb3 Qc7 15 Q:c3 Bd7 16 Ne5
Nd5. Here too, however, White
could continue 17 Qb2 B:c6 18 N:c6
Q:c6 19 Bf3, and hold a definite
plus, thanks to his bishop pair,
open files and extra center pawn.

Gligoric has completed the first
part of his plan: the d-pawn is
now fixed firmly in place. Euwe
hopes to stir up some play onthe
kingside, but White easily repels
Black's threats, and by steadily
trading off minor pieces, draws


[248}


closer and closer to his goal:
a battle of heavy pieces for
the isolated pawn.

This move is the tactical
justification for White's whole
plan. If the rook were forced to
retreat from c5 here, the ex-
change of bishops would leave
White with an isolated pawn as
well, and there would be no
further reason why he should
think about winning.

In order to understand what
follows, one must keep in mind
that rook endings with four
pawns to three, all on one side,
generally cannot be won. So if
all of the queenside pawns dis-
appear, Black would be risking
very little even if he does lose
the isolated d-pawn. With this
in mind, 25 b5, which leads to
exchanges, is not a very good
move: 25 Qd2 would be more con-
sistent, threatening 26 e4 and
forcing 25..f5.


Attacking the isolated pawn
on the file with the threat of
e3-e4 is a technique common to
such endings.

The pawn can no longer be de-

Black hopes to get the queens

Here, Gligoric, who has man-
aged the game very consistently
and powerfully up to now, com-
mits a small imaccuracy, but a
very common one. Having forced
Black to abandon the d-pawn's
defense, he ought not to have
taken it just yet, as this gives
Euwe the chance to bring his
rook to a good position. 31 Kg2
was correct; if then 31..Qcl, he
should avoid trading queens for
the moment by playing his queen
to b4. Here it is important that
the variation 31..Qc1l 32 Qb4Rc2

but important, that White can
accomplish nothing by attacking
the pawn from behind: 34 Rd8+
Kg7 35 Rb8& Rb5, and White can-
not play 36 a6.


And so, in a few moves we shall
see the theoretically drawn four
vs. three-pawn rook endgame. Gli-
goric wants to test theory's con-
clusion, to see how much truth
there is in it; so he plays on
for a while, risking nothing. For
the moment, he simply places his
pawns more actively.

Opinions vary on this move.
Euwe gave it an exclamationmark,
calling it "a pawn sacrifice rich
with possibilities", while Tri-
funovic considered it a serious
mistake, allowing Black to trade
off two pawns. He recommended
postponing g4-g5 in favor of the
preparatory moves Kg3, £3, e4,
Kf£4 and Ra6. I submit that nei-
ther of them is completely cor-
rect: Black need not lose here,
regardless of whether or not
White plays g4-g5.


The move g4-g5 is interesting
from a psychological standpoint.
It was played just before the


time-control, leaving Euwe to
decide whether to reply 38..gh,
which weakens his pawn forma-
tion — "but who would have im-
agined that this would play


such an important role in the

39. RaS-a6 wigie
Beautifully played! Now ..h7-
h6 will be impossible, of
course, but White is also
threatening to bring up his pawn
to e4, his king to £5, and his
rook to h6. White wins this end-
ing, if he can capture the h5-
pawn while keeping the pawns at
£7 and h7 in place.


39, eae Rb7-b3


Either Euwe had no time left
to think, or else he considered
he could draw as he pleased ;
in any case, he was not paying
sufficient attention to his op-
ponent's plan. The rook had to
be brought to e6, when it turns
out that exchanging rooks re-
sults in a king and pawn endgame
that Black can just barely draw:
39..Re7 40 Kg3 Reé 41 R:e6 fe
42 Kh4 Kg6 43 £4 ho. If White
does not take on e6, then Black
plays ..h7-h6; and if White ans-
wers 39..Re7 with 40 Rh6, then
40..Re5 41 R:h5 Kg6. Curiously,
the rook can only be transferred


[250]


to e6 via e7: Euwe's recommenda-
tion 39..Rb4 40 £4 Re4 41 Kf3
Re6, etc., is refuted by 40f3,
by which White covers both 294
and e4, keeping Black's rook

off the sixth rank and threaten-
ing 41 Rhé.

Euwe might have adjourned the
game on move 40, but continued
playing until the 44th move, dur-
ing which time he succeeded in
committing his final mistake.
Advancing this pawn gave White's
king the square g4 and shortened
the range of his own rook enough
to give White sufficient basis
for a real winning attempt. With
the black pawn at h5, I do not
believe a win would have been
possible. If, for instance, White
sets up this position: Kf£5, Rb/,
and pawns at £4, e5 and g5, with
the threat of e5-e6, then Black
puts his rook on the e-file,
which renders the pawn advance
unplayable, and White's king
has no move either.

From now on, this position
will be included in every end-
game textbook. The winning me-
thod, discovered by Gligoric
in actual play, is not only
pretty and logically consistent,
but a valuable addition to theo-
ry as well.


Reaching the final position
will require White to advance
his pawn from e5 to e6 with his
rook on the seventh rank, but


this is not immediately play-
able. Gligoric's plan to make
it so may be divided into the
following stages:


1) induce the black h-pawn to
advance, and then capture it;


2) bring his own rook to dl
and drive the enemy rook from
the e-file;


3) carry out the final maneu-
ver by pushing the f-pawn to
£5 and the e-pawn to e6 with
the support of the king and
rook.
49, £2-f£4 h4-h3

It was noted in the first ed-
ition of this book that Black
advanced this pawn to h3 inview
of the threat of 50 Kg4, since
the white king could now cap-
ture the h-pawn while his f-pawn
is on £4: 50 Kg4 Rgit+ 51 K:h4 Rhit+
52 Kge4 R:h6 53 gh+ K:h654 £5,
when the pawn ending is won for
White.


But as Orlov, an amateur from
Leningrad, has pointed out, this
is not so: the ending is adraw!
Black continues 54..Kg7 55 Kg5
f6+ 56 ef+ Kf7. He also notes
that the text move (49..h3) is
necessary, but for a different
reason: 50 Kg4 Rgi+ 51 Kh3! Rhi+
52 Kg2, which wins the pawn.

A pretty move, which aims by
the use of zugzwang either to
force the king to retreat or to
force the rook to move, after
which the white king can attack
and capture the h-pawn. White's
rook had to go to f6 in order
to defend the f-pawn.


An interesting line is 54..Kg8
55 Kg3 Kg7 56 Kg4 Kg8 57 Rho,
and the pawn falls, since if the
rooks are exchanged by 57..Rgi+
58 K:h3 Rhi+ 59 Kg4 R:h6 60 gh,
the black king can no longer
reach the pawn at hé.

In Orlov's opinion, this was
the decisive mistake by Black,
who let the draw slip here. This
could have been obtained, he
says, by 57..Rg1+ 58 K:h3 Rhit+
59 Kg4 R:h6 60 gh £6 61 ef Kf7
ne Kf£5 Kf8 63 Ke6 Ke8 64 f£7+
Kf8.


I was just preparing myself
to argue with this capable Len-
ingrad analyst, when my thunder
was stolen by the well-known ex-
pert on pawn endgames, Igor Mai-
zelis, who pointed out that in
exactly the position where Orlov
ends his analysis in the belief
that it is an obvious drawWhite
can win with a maneuver remini-~
scent of a composed study: 65 Kd6!!
K:£7 66 Kd7 Kf8 67 Ke6, etc.
And if Black plays 62..Ke8 in
Orlov's line (instead of 62..Kf§),
then 63 Ke6 Kf£8 64 Kd7 Kf7
65 Kd&8 Kf8 66 £7 K:f7 67 Kd?
Kf£6 68 Ke8, and the white king
attacks and captures the last
black pawn, and then shepherds
its own pawn through to hé&.


Additionally, Master Fridstein
has pointed out that, in Orlov's
line with 57..Rgi+ instead of
57..h2, White is not obliged to
take on the pawn ending, but can


capture the pawn by a different
route: 58 Kf3 Rf1+ 59 Kg3 Rgit+
60 Kf2 Rh1 61 Rh4. All that re-
mains is for me to thank Messrs.
Orlov, Maizelis and Fridstein
for their interesting and val-
uable comments.

White has now completed the
first part of his plan, but the
win is not easy even yet: his
king is cut off, and the f-pawn
needs protection.


As a matter of fact, couldn't
Black cut off the white king on
the h-file permanently? No, be-
cause after 60 Rf6 Kg/ 61 Kh3
Rel 62 Ra6 the threat to advance
the e-pawn (with the king at h5
and the rook at a7) would force
Black's rook off the g-file.

64. Kg4-f£5 Rg1i-f1


Black has selected the defen-
sive plan of tying White's king
to the f-pawn. By attacking the
f-pawn from behind, Black leaves
his king relatively free to ma-
neuver (..Kg7-f£8-¢7), while also
preventing the white king from
occupying £6; with White's rook
on the seventh rank, this would
decide the game at once. When
White's king comes out, Black's
rook will check on the files,
but Gligoric finds a skillful
maneuver to drive Black's rook
from the f-file and secure the
win.


As Euwe points out, 64..Ral,
Black's other possible plan here,
would not have saved him either:
65 Rc6 Rad 66 Rc7 Kf8 67 Kg4 Ral
68 £5, and now comes a series of
checks, which the king escapes
on c8: 68..Rgi+ 69 Kf4 Rf1it+
70 Ke4 Rel+ 71 Kd5 Rdi+ 72 Kce6é
Rel+ 73 Kd7 Rdi+ 74 Kc8 Rd5

ing the trade of rooks White
reaches a won pawn ending:

if 74..Rg1, then 75 f6 R:g5
76 Kd7, etc.

Had Black not played 64..Rf1,

Thus, White has now completed

is all ready to push his pawns
to £5 and e6, once the black rook
has been forced off the f-file.
If the rook does not leave the
file, then the king must go ei-
ther to g8 or to £8, which would
leave it perilously placed in-

In my preparations for the

by this flank attack, which seemed
to refute Black's plan of bring-
ing a knight to e6. On 10..g6,

11 B:£6 B:f6 12 h5 is very strong,
and on 10..h6 I intended to con-
tinue 11 B:f6 B:f£6 12 g4, fol-
lowed by queenside castling and
g4-25; I felt such an attack
would have to succeed. But Stahl-

White is short the one tempo he
needs in order to continue with

have played 12 g4, however, but
with the idea, after 12..Nc7, of
laying aside temporarily his
ideas of a crushing attack, in
favor of a plan to accumulate
positional advantages, beginning
with 13 Bf5. White s irrepres-

forces him back on the defensive.

White has no sense of the dan-
ger — such is the power of his
faith in the amulet on e6. While
the white queen dances back and
forth, Black is making a passed
pawn of his own; thereafter,
White's affairs take a sharp
turn for the worse. Of course,
the pawn at e6 does constrict
Black's forces powerfully, but
White's pieces are tied to it
as well. The only real advantage
it confers on White is the great-
er mobility of his rook. There-
fore, before Black finds time to
regroup, the king should be sent
out to save the pawn, especially
now that the road that leads to
it (a2-b3-c4-d5), although com-
pletely open, is also completely
safe. But a king-march to the
middle of the board with queens
and rooks still on the board is


nothing to be lightly undertaken;
White — mistakenly — hesitates to
make the decision.

he throws himself into the riv-

4152. Reshevsky—Bolesiavsky
(King’s Indian)


Chess is a limitless game; to
avoid losing his way in it, the


chessplayer will use certain
guideposts to orient himself

in the evaluation of a position
and the selection of a plan, such
as weak pawns, open files, a lead
in development, good and bad bi-
shops, a poorly placed king, and
so on. It is worth noting that
one will not find in every game
such guideposts as will allow

one to compare a position's good
and bad points and to choose a
proper plan on that basis. Ei-
ther chess theory has not yet
found a quantity of guideposts
sufficient to exhaust the game's
diversity, or else there are posi-
tions in which the balance has
been upset more than once, and
guideposts are hard to discern.
In any event, one frequently
finds the sort of game which must
be played for quite some time on
nothing more than gut feeling
and calculation, and this is the
hardest sort of game to play,


even for a grandmaster.

This move is, of course, not
classical. A piece is developed
somewhere out on the rim, im-
mediately makes another move,
and winds up at c7, which has
never been considered a very
good square for a knight. How-
ever, ideas such as this occur
frequently in the modern type
of game, where they are danger-
ous precisely because of their
seeming illogic and, at the
same time, their preeminent
practicality.


The whole point to the maneu-
ver ..Nb8-a6-c7 and ..Ra8-b8 is
that Black wants to play ..b7-b5
without recourse to ..a/-a6. Why
play ..b/-b5, when White can re-
ply simply b2-b3? Not so fast:
in order to play b2-b3, White
must first remove two of his
pieces from the long diagonal;
after that, however, Black can
trade pawns on c4, followed by
bishop to a6 and rook to b4, when
White will have a very difficult
time defending his c-pawn. It

From here until approximately
the 23rd move, the game follows
a long and complicated course of
tactical calculation, for which
no all-inclusive general rules
have yet been formulated. In
the art of complex combinative
calculation, these two are wor-
thy foes— in fact, at the time
this tournament was played they
were, along with Geller and Tai-
manov, the best calculating play-
ers in the world. Naturally, this
does not by any means lessen
their stature as positional play-
ers.


Let's examine a few of the
combinative motifs that will
occur during the creative pro-
cess. Black‘s rook, having left
a8, now defends the b7-pawn, but
the knight and the rook are now
subject to diagonal attack. Af-
ter the white queen's bishop


leaves cl, the b2-pawn will be
left undefended, and the black
king's bishop will be able to
capture it with tempo. After
White's knight captures the d6-
pawn, the squares e8 and c8
will be closed to Black's rooks,
and moving the bishop to e7 will
win White the exchange; and so
forth, and so on. This is far
from being a complete listing,
of course: merely fragmented
glimpses of the sort of general
ideas that take shape in the
chessplayer's mind as he makes
his choice of possible contin-
uations.

Boleslavsky is trying to en-

Qe6 brings White no special re-
wards, while further losses will
not be long in coming his way.

The prospect of giving up a
rook for the darksquare bishop
and picking up a pair of pawns
as interest, naturally, doesn't
disturb Black at all. But Resh-
evsky has spotted an important
peculiarity of the forthcoming
endgame: his rooks will be able
to act in concert against Black's
bishop and two pawns. The only
thing that gives him some slight
pause is Black's possession of
two powerful bishops.

20. Bg2-f1 a88

A pretty move to conclude this
game’s combinative phase: Black's
assets will no longer include
the pair of bishops. His rook
can no more leave £8 than his
queen's bishop can avoid ex-
change. Now White can exploit
his lead in development and the
strong position of his rooks. On
the other hand, Black's position
is by no means lost: it is his
overassessment of his own chances
that costs him the game later.

A knight's strength is doub-

Had Boleslavsky played 21..Ne6,
he would have obtained a solid

moving to d4 also if necessary.

Beautiful play! White threat~
ens to trade off Black's rook
and attack the pawns from be-

obviously have been impossible
if the knight stood at e6, which
is why it was so important to
close the e-file with the knight.
Now Black has to take the knight,
since 23..Kg7 allows 24 Ne8+ and
25 Red.

24. Re2-d2
Had Black gone after the g-
pawn, he would have lost to
24..B:g3 25 hg Nc7 26 Re7 Neo
27 Rdd7. However, it's difficult
to believe that with two pawns
for the exchange, Black could
think of no more active move
than 24..Bf8. He might have
tried picking off a third pawn
with 24..Nb6, for instance. On
the other hand, if the author
had been playing Black here,
and had moved his knight to b6,
and then lost, Boleslavsky might
then have written in his notes
that 24..Bf8 should have been
tried — and he, in his turn,
would have been right also.

25. Rd2:d5 c5-c4

Black wants to push this pawn
to c3 so it can be defended by
the bishop. If 25..a6, Euwe re-
commends 26 Rde5 b5 27 a5, with
the idea of winning the a-pawn.
To my way of thinking, 26 a5 is
a sounder line for White.

26. Rel-e4

Refuting Black's idea. 26 Rel
Rc8, followed by ..c3 and..Bg/7,
would leave Black with no wor-
ries; but now 26..Rc8 would be
met by 27 Rdd4 c3 28 Rc4, and
after the rooks are exchanged,
the pawn must fall: 28..R:c4
29 R:c4 Bg7? 30 Rc8+.


The same result follows 26..c3
27 Rc4 Bg7 28 Rdc5!, and after
the unavoidable exchange of rooks,
White wins easily by bringing his
king to d3, after which his un-
chained rook begins to reap the
defenseless black a- and b-pawns.


26. a7-a6


Boleslavsky has one last chance:


to trade off White's a-pawn and
advance his one remaining compen-
sating pawn as far as possible.

To understand the following
curious events, one must know,
first of all, that they oc-
curred while Reshevsky was in
tremendous time-trouble; and
secondly, that all of this oc-
curred very late at night. The
twenty-second round fell on a
Saturday. For religious reasons,
Reshevsky started his Saturday
games some hours after the us-
ual time — after the rise of the
evening star; on Fridays, he
played his games during the day,
so as to finish before the rise
of that same star.


Fearing to leave something
hanging in time-pressure, Resh-
evsky decides to play Rf7-f3-
d3-d7-f7, which was playable
with Black's pawn at b3, but
allowed Black a saving clause
when the pawn went to b2.

And here, Black might have

and in the light of day he would
no doubt have seen and played
that move; but at 2:00 a.m., and


after a tense and exhausting

After this, Keres transposes

There exists a barely percep-
tible difference between White's
position and Black's. How much
is "barely"? White's bishop is
on g2, while Black's is on e7.
Keres asks himself, "How may
this affect the further course
of play?", and answers, "The
white queen has the square e2,
while the symmetrical square e/7
is occupied by Black's bishop,
and his queen will be uncomfort-
able on an open file." Thus,
White's plan begins with the
moves e3, Qe2 and Rfd1 — but
this is only a beginning.

Black must clear d8 for his

A brilliant move, completely

triply attacked, and only the

it turns out, however, the c6

154. Smyslov—Geller
(King’s Indian)

One of the postulates of open-
ing theory reads as follows: In
the opening, White should always
play to gain the advantage, while
Black should always play to equal-
ize. I do not know the precise
formulation of Geller's views, but
to judge from his games, he appar-
ently believes that whichever side
he happens to be playing is the
side that ought to get the better
of the opening.


The chief characteristics of
Geller's creativity are an ama-
zing ability to extract the very
maximum from the opening and a
readiness to abandon positional
schemes for an open game rife
with combinations, or vice ver-
sa, at any moment.

out incurring any weaknesses him-
self. He would like to make the
first breach in the fortress
wall at d6 — but now this sud-
den knight sortie, with its un-
mistakable threat of 11..Qh4,

11..Qb6 comes to the same thing
after 12 hg Q:d4 (but not 12..B:d4

An outstanding idea! Smyslov
establishes an outpost in the
immediate vicinity of the en-
emy army's general headquarters.
And although this cheeky pawn
is cut off from its own chain,
directly or indirectly it holds
back three of the enemy. Most
importantly, it holds down the
thematic King's Indian thrust

With the queens exchanged,
Black is ready to trade bishop
for knight as well, if he can
get a pawn into the bargain: for
example, 17 £4 B:c3 18 be N:e4.
So White contents himself with
the more modest 17 £3, waiting
for the right moment to drive
the bishop from e5 and take the
d-pawn. A position of dynamic
equilibrium results. Black now
advances his queenside pawns,
but all the while he must keep
an eye on the central grouping





of his own and the enemy forces.

White's last move was to de-

transfer the knight via e2 to

maneuver with the following ag-
gressive line: 21 Ne2 Nd3 22 Rb1
b5 23 cb Ba2 24 Ral Bb3, with
interesting complications. If
Geller had been in a peaceable
mood, he would probably have
played 20..f6, and after 21gf
B:f6 the game would most likely
have been drawn.

21. Rel-bi h7-h6

Geller decides to liquidate
the unpleasant g5-pawn at the
precise moment when both White's
rooks are located on the same
diagonal, as though to invite
an attack from the bishop at f5.
However, Smyslov refutes Black's
idea by means of an accurately
calculated counterblow.

Once again Keres employs the
new defense, specially prepared
for this tournament, which he
used successfully against Stahl-
berg (see Game 33). Geller's
plan of attack with 7 e4 takes
us out of the realm of the posi-
tional schemes of the Queen's
Gambit and into the sphere of
the open games of the Italian
School. On 7..de, White trades
queens and continues 9 Ng5, at-
tacking the pawns at f7 and e4.


7. eos Nb8-c6
8. Bfl-b5 Nf6:e4
9. 0-0 eee


Geller plays in classical
style. Having sacrificed a
pawn, he is in no hurry to re-
cover it, bringing out his
pieces instead for an attack
on the king.

Or. ots Ne4-f6

Black's task must be to remove
his king from the center at all
costs, otherwise an extra pawn
or even an extra piece will not
save him from a fierce attack.
The task is not solved by ex-
changing knights at c3, since
9..N:c3 10 Q:c3 would leave the
g7-pawn under fire from the
white queen, as before, and the
dark-square bishop would remain
unable to move and clear the
way for castling kingside.


10,
11.


Rf1-e1+ Bf£8-e7

Qd4-e5 Sas

One who plays an open game must
not only search for and invent
various attacks and combinations,
but also keep a sharp eye onhis
opponent, and never forget that
he may also come up with a clev-
er idea himself. Thus, at first
Geller's move looks quite strong:
it pins the bishop and delays
Black's castling, and on 11..Be6
12 Nd4 is very uncomfortable.


[264]





However, Keres finds a pret-
ty combinative solution: even
though he "cannot™ castle, he
does so anyway! Immediately,
White's position is practically
hopeless, since he no longer
has either his attack or his
pawn. So Geller's correct stra-
tegical idea must have fallen
victim to an incorrect tactical
execution.


Geller could have kept the
king in the center for quite
some time by means of the maneu-
ver 11 B:c6+ be 12 Qe5, when his
threats of 13 Nd4 and 13 b3 fol-
lowed by 14 Ba3 would have forced
an immediate 12..Kf8.

White might have won back his

16 Q:e8+ Q:e8 17 R:e8+ R:e8
18 R:d5 — but he could hardly
have had any hopes of saving
the endgame then. White's
knights would have had no points
of support, and would have had
to stay tied to their posts,
while Black's bishops would hold
absolute sway over the board.
Sooner or later, White's a-
and b-pawns would have fallen.

White has the freer position,
with significantly more lines
available for various regroup-
ings. Since his darksquare bi-
shop is on the al-h8 diagonal,
it looks very tempting to bring
a rook to g3, but he must also
counter Black's efforts to in-
crease the scope of his own
pieces by ..c7-c5 or ..e6-e5.

A very risky decision. The
plan to take over the d-file
should have been implemented
with something like 35 Rce1 and
36 Red1. This foolhardy push of

the game. It decisively weakens
two diagonals, both of them vi-

As the game's further course

is in a hopeless predicament; or

The courage of despair. The
white pieces are very poorly
placed: the rooks lack scope,
the queen is buried, and every
pawn stands quite as passively
as the next. Even the bishop
stands alone, in the middle of
Black's pieces. It is therefore
understandable that the Swedish
grandmaster should wish to see
his knight set free, at least.

forces his opponent to lay down

As we leave the opening for
the middlegame stage, the chances
lie with White. His advantage
consists of the more active place-
ment of his pieces and his con-
trol of the d-file. White now
essays a curious combination,
which unfortunately falls short
of its mark; so playing the oth-
er knight straightforwardly out
to g5 was therefore better. After
18 Neg5, Black would have had
nothing better than to play
18..g6, and after 19 h4 and 20h5,
the black king's position might
become very unsafe, in view of
White's standing threat to sac-
rifice a piece at e6 and enter


at g6 with his queen. Besides,
after 18 Neg5 g6 the square f6

By maintaining the pawn ten-

vents White's e3-e4, so Szabo
seeks an exit for his bishop
on the a3-f£8 diagonal. As soon
as he plays 11 a4, however, Naj-
dorf immediately closes the cen-
ter and stations his knight at
e4, giving White the choice of
trading off his bishop or wor-
rying over his c3-pawn. This
game is significant for opening
theory, since Najdorf's 12th


move is an improvement on the
game Taimanov - Botvinnik from
the XX USSR Championship.

ture, which makes use of the fact
that the e3-pawn is twice attacked
and f2-f3 is therefore impossible.
After 16..de, both White's bi-
shops would remain blockaded for
some time. Black could exploit
this to create threats against
the white king: for example,

17 Qd2 Bg4 (threatening ..Bf3)
18 Khl Re6é 19 Bdi Rh6é 50 B:24
Q:g4 21 £3 Qg3 22 h3 ef 23 R:f3
R:h3+.

31. scare £7-£5


The f-pawn is the only weak
spot in Black's position. Why
not play simply 31..Kg7, defen-
ding £6 at the same time? That
would have assured the fall of
White's a-pawn, for no compen-
sation, and Black's win would
then have been quite easy.

Au Zs Ws Indeed, White plays 44 Rg2,

changed Black can win the bi-

of the perpetual check. 43..Qb1
leads nowhere for the same reas-

move, however, Black could have
tried 43..Q:£4+ 44 ef Kg8, when
45 Re5 fails to 45..Nd2!, threat-
ening mate in two. If Black's
king gets to the queenside, he
will have real winning chances,
since he will have an extra pawn,
for all practical purposes.
Black's position was so strong
that not even two inaccuracies

quiet 14 Nc3 retains the better
chances for White, despite the
pair of black bishops, thanks
to White's queenside majority of

the best move.

For the price of a pawn, Black
has managed to hold White's king
in the center. Far more important
in this situation, however, is


the opening of the f-file, since
even before ..£4:23, castling would
not have been without danger to
White, in view of his weakened
pawn wall £2-g3-h4. Petrosian
plays the next part of the game
very resourcefully, and succeeds
in warding off his opponent's
threats while retaining his ma-
terial advantage.

Of course it would have been
difficult to calculate accurate-
ly all the consequences of 23..e4,
but it would have brought about
a completely muddled position,
in which Black is not without
chances — and that was precisely
what Szabo aimed for in sacri-
ficing the first pawn.

If only his bishop could help
the queen, just a little! Con-
cluding that now, at last, it's
time to come out of the shadows,
the bishop shoulders its pawn
aside, but — alas! — too late.
White's pieces begin their coun-
terattack, and thanks to their
numerical superiority, they
sweep all before them.

For some reason, the masters
in this tournament seemed to
favor defensive systems with
a queen's bishop fianchetto
against Najdorf (see, for ex-
ample, Games 94 and 118). In
this game, Najdorf employs one
of the best continuations, which
forces Black to exchange pawns
under most unfavorable circum-
stances.

An excellent reply, with the
idea of controlling the central
light squares with his bishop
and the dark squares with his
pawns. Despite the fact that this
exchange doubles and isolates
the white pawns, it is precisely
this queen exchange that makes
them no longer weak, since the
rook will be unable to reach
them.

After the eighth rank, there's

wishes to take this opportunity
to dispel a mistaken notion cur-
rent among some beginners that
according to the laws of chess,
if a king reaches the eighth
rank, one captured pawn may be
taken back. In this tournament,
several kings made it to the
eighth rank, and the reader may
see for himself that no pawns
appeared on the board as a re-
sult. This is a nonexistent
"rule", artificial and contra-
ry to the logic of chess, whose
laws are the product of many

In the Queen's Indian we occa-
sionally see a fianchettoed ...
king. What would impel White to
develop his bishop at g2 and
then trade it off immediately?
Certainly it is not that the
king is so well placed on g2.
No, thé explanation lies in the
fact that in the Queen's Indian
the positional battle hinges
on the advance ..d7-d5. If White
can restrain it, he has the bet-
ter game; if Black enforces it,
he equalizes. White therefore
trades bishops in order to neu-


[280}


tralize the queen's bishop's
support of this advance, and
the king ends up on g2.


In other lines, White plays
Nf3-e1, recapturing on g2 with
the knight.

therefore harmless, means.

What made Reshevsky aim for
such a position out of the open-
ing? Isn't it symmetrical, with
no advantage of any kind for
White? Symmetrical, yes — but
not entirely. Geller has pawns
on light squares; consequently,
the squares in front of themare
dark squares, and White will be
able to establish his knight on
these squares, where the lLight-
square bishop Geller is now left
with cannot drive it away. Fur-
ther, Black cannot avoid having


to play ..c7-c6, and this will
create a notch which White's
attacking pawns can grapple.
Thus, White has prospects of
further strengthening his posi-
tion, while Black must operate
on the kingside whether he will
or no-— here, however, the mo-
dus operandi is not so clear.

The obverse of the standard
minority attack appears if White
simply trades knights: 16 N:e6

Bh3 20 B£3 B:g2!,and Black's
queenside holds, while White's
kingside is already in ruins.
The ability to temper attackwith
defense is one of the chessmas-
ter's most valued, essential
skills. Total immersion in one's
own plan generally leads to un-
derestimating that of one's op-
ponent. Forgetting this ax-
iom cost Reshevsky a half-point
after adjournment.

17. NhS-g3 Ra8-c8

Black should always play ..a/7-
a6 in these cases to induce White
to play a2-a4; then, if the "mi-
nority'' advances any further, it
will involve a pawn exchange. The
more pawns Black can trade off,
the fewer his queenside weak-
nesses.


19. b4-b5 eee


This break is based on the
fact that after 19..cb 20 Qb3,
no matter how Black replies,
White not only wins his pawn
back, but gains another aswell.


19, wee Ng5-e4
20. Qc3-a5 sets


The queen attacks the a-pawn.
Had Black moved it up to a6 at
the proper time, he would be in
a great deal less trouble now.


20. disks c6-c5!


In his difficult position, Gel-
ler does not lose his resource-
fulness or presence of mind. See-
ing that "normal" play will re-
sult in a slow death for Black,
he gives up the pawn and allows
White two connected passed pawns,
but creates an interesting coun-
terchance in the form of a far-
advanced c-pawn. If 21 Q:a7, for
example, then 21..c4.

Now Geller's tactics are jus-

swift advance, followed by the
d-pawn, Reshevsky hurriedly ex-
changes queens, and now real
drawing possibilities begin to
appear. Black would have had a
harder job after 27 b6 or 27 Rd4,

One of those rare cases in
Geller's career where he over-
looks a saving combination, this


one based on the white king's
lack of an "airhole™: 31..R:a3

32 b7 Rb4 33 Rd8+ Kh7 34 b8Q

R:b8 35 R:b8 Rd3 36 Rf1 Rc3!

Now White has nothing better than
to enter a “"four-vs.-three" rook-
and-pawn ending, which theory
considers drawn (cf. Game 150,
Gligoric - Euwe).

37. e4-e5 h5-h4
38. Rd6<d4 sles


And here it might seem that
nothing could save Black. Nev-
ertheless, I would not have
traded my b-pawn for the in-
significant h-pawn. Couldn't
White have relocated his rook
on the seventh rank? After
38 e6 £6 39 Re? R:b6 40 Réd7,
it seems White's idea has jelled
(and this, by the way, is the
same sort of sudden assault on
g7? Reshevsky used once before in
this tournament, against Euwe ).


38. ok Rb2 :b6
39. Rc6:b6 Rb8:b6
40. Rd4:h4 seaa


In order to understand what
follows, keep in mind that there
are some rook endings in which
two extra pawns are not enough
to win. As an example, sometimes
it is impossible to win the end-
ing with rook and f- and h-pawns
against rook, or rook and two
connected passed pawns against
rook, if the pawns can be block-
aded. Geller is hoping to trans-
pose into one of these endgames.

168. Keres—Smyslov
(English Opening)

On the eve of the 24th round,
Keres was a half-point behind
Smyslov, but Keres was due for
his bye in the 25th round. In
the event of a draw with Smys-
lov, he would fall either a
point or a point and a half be-
hind Smyslov, depending on how the
latter scored against Reshevsky
in Round 25. Thus, we can see
the psychological circumstance
which impelled Keres to try his
luck with a strange, sharp king-
side attack, using only his two
rooks without the aid of his
pawns.


Keres either could not or
would not make methodical and
logical preparations for his
attack. As early as the 19th
move, he offered a rook, as the
English expression goes, "for
nothing". Our understanding of
sacrifices usually involves some
resounding check — B: h7+ or
R:g7+ — forcing one's opponent
to capture the piece. However,
the finest sacrifices are a bit
different: the rook is attacked,
but it does not move...

"I thought for a long time,"
said Smyslov afterwards, “over
whether or not I should give in,
and accept the rook — the more
so, in that I was unable to see
how White would be able to win
here..." Indeed, to take awhole
rook for nothing! The worst of
it is, what if I don't take it,
and then lose? And look: next
move, the rook will take off the
h-pawn — well, then, grab it!
Calculating all the variations
over the board is obviously not
possible; all one can do is to
examine the main lines and trust
in oneself.


19. eee d5:c4


Smyslov's intuition did not
deceive him: as later analysis
was to show, he made the best
move here. But how did he ar-
rive at it? What sort of mech-
anism, if one may so call it,
operates a grandmaster's intui-
tion? Did Smyslov reason
it out, or did he simply guess,
as one might do in a lottery,
and pull out a winning number?

Of course the text move re~
sulted from a deep study of the
position. First of all, Black
is opening his bishop's diagonal,
creating the possibility of
transferring that piece via e4
to £5 or g6. Secondly, the d-
file is opened, creating the
possibility of moving the queen
to a5 and attacking the square
g2 along the diagonal, or sim-
ply taking the d4-pawn with the
queen. And thirdly, a passed c-
pawn temporarily makes its ap-
pearance; it may go on to c3,
closing the diagonal of the dan-
gerous white bishop... Meanwhile,
the white rook is still enprise,
and now the basic threat oe
..g6:h5 is a real one; for on
20 be, for example, 20..gh21 Q:h5
Be4.


Still, we are all curious to
see what might have happened if
Black had taken the rook right
away — wouldn't 19..gh 20 Q:h5
Re8 have saved him, by opening
an escape hatch for the king? No,
since White would have cut off
his escape with the startling

ROUND TWENTY-FIVE


169. Smyslov—Reshevsky
(Reti Opening)

In his battle for the right to
play a match for the world's
championship, Smyslov had just
survived a fierce struggle with
Keres; his next opponent, Resh-
evsky, was just as aggressively
inclined.


At this moment, Reshevsky had
half a point less than Smyslov,
with one more game played. So,
strictly speaking, even a win
would not have allowed Reshevsky
to overtake the leader, while a
draw would clearly have been un-
suitable. So, like Keres, the
American also set himself the
task of winning at all costs.

7. Qdi-b3 Bb4:c¢3


The rather unusual 3..Bb4, fol-
lowed by the exchange 9n c3, was
evidently something Reshevsky
had prepared with the intention
of obtaining a position bearing
the least possible resemblance
to anything in theory, and of
carrying on the fight with his
knights against the enemy's bi-
shops.

11. d2-d4 Nb8-d7

A proper move, typical of a
Queen's Indian Defense: Black
places his bishop in front of
its pawn chain, so that now he
need no longer fear White's d4-
d5. If the bishop had remained
on b7, it would have been doomed
to passivity, whereas now it is
fully the equal of White's bi-
shop on g2.


13. d4:c5 Nd7:c5
14. Qc3-e3 oes


A powerful move, combining
the tactical threat of 15 B:f6
and 16 b4 with the positional
idea of either driving the bi-
shop out or inducing the e-


pawn's advance.
14. aes e6-e5


Black has now more or less neu-
tralized the two bishops. The bi-
shop on e4 stands guard over one,
while the other is hemmed in by
Black's pawns. Of course, the d-
pawn will be a source of worry,
but this is no great danger, as
long as Black's position con-
tains no other weaknesses. White's
following maneuvers aim at get-
ting the black bishop for his
knight.


15. Bg2-h3 a7veas
16. N£3-h4 Rf8-e8

White could also have achieved
his ends without this move, since
17 N£5 would have forced Black to
give up the bishop; but Smyslov
leaves himself the option of tak-
ing the bishop on g6 at a later
time, under more favorable cir-
cumstances.

Even here, it cannot be said
that White's bishop-pair con-
fers on him any kind of sub-
stantial advantage. This is a
balanced position, which here
presages, not a draw, but ra-
ther an interesting struggle.

In the course of the next ten
or twelve moves, both sides ma-
neuver, while hiding their plans
from each other, and await the
moment when the constellation of
pieces will allow them to take
decisive action.

22. Nh5-£6

White's bishops are still re-
stricted, but his darksquare bi-
shop can go to e3, which is the
intersection point of two impor-
tant diagonals. Black should have
forestalled this while attempting
to seize the initiative on the
kingside with 22..f5!


One may imagine that perhaps
Reshevsky deliberately refrained
from playing this here, in order
to play it after White had played
e2-e4, and closer to the time-
control, for the sake of further
complicating matters. However,
this tactic proved unsuccessful
against Smyslov's clear, logical
play.

We must give this move two ex-
clamation marks, as otherwise we
would have to give one to each
of Smyslov's moves. He emerges
as the winner of this game from
both the chessplaying and the
psychological point of view.
Reshevsky was unable to fathom
the plan behind his moves. Here,


[286]


Smyslov only feinted at f3-f4,
while he was really preparing a
battery on the diagonal gi-a/.
Now a2-a3 and b3-b4 is the threat,
driving the knight away so as
to attack the b-pawn. 33 Rc2 was
played to eliminate the reply
.-N:b3 after his 34 a3, and to
support the break c4-c5 in some
lines. As for Black's pieces,
the only difference between their
positions now and what it was
eleven moves ago is that the king
has gone from g8 to h? — and
even this slight change is not
to Black's advantage.

33. £7-f5

Reshevsky now executes his
long-delayed thrust, when he
no longer has any real choice.
The rest follows quite swiftly,
presenting a sharp contrast to
the deliberate maneuvers of the
preceding stage.

Black may already have gone

has cleverly exploited his part-

queenside pressure, although
there were no real threats as

of a pawn was totally uncalled

171. Kotov—Gligoric
(King’s Indian)

In the struggle that is chess,
the blockade is not just an im-
portant technique, but also one
of the elements in the strategic
plan. The methods for dealing
with any enemy piece may be
ranked in descending value as
follows: capture (or elimina-
tion), exchange, attack, block-
ade. The attacked piece may be
defended in any of several ways:
retreat is the simplest, but it
may also be shielded, or the at-
tacking piece may be captured.
The idea behind the blockade is
first to deprive the target
piece of its mobility before
actually attacking it.


In the most general sense, a
blockade may be employed against
any piece, including the king,
but when we speak of the block-
ade in practical terms, generally
it is in reference to pawns. They
are the easiest to blockade, and
the most dangerous pieces when
set in motion.


Which pieces best fill the
role of blockader? First and
foremost, of course, the knight,
since while it blocks the path
of the pawn it also attacks the
squares diagonally behind it.
The bishop is also useful for
this purpose, since it can pre-
vent the advance of several
pawns simultaneously. One may
also blockade a pawn with a
pawn, but that is a double-
edged weapon, since the block-
ading pawn becomes blockaded
itself.


These are the blockade's sim-
plest facets; the reality of
chess is a great deal more com-
plicated. In the Kotov - Gligo-
ric game, Black succeeded in
maintaining a blockade of a con-
siderable length of pawn chain,
thereby severely restricting,
not only the pawns, but the pieces
too. Naturally, Gligoric didnot
achieve all this for nothing: it
cost him a great deal of thought—
and two pawns.

After the sufferings he en-
dured in his games with Geller
and Petrosian from White's con-
tinual threat of c4-c5, Gligor-
ic decides to close the center.
Although this does deprive his
knight of the square c5, it also
retains solid control of d4, even
if his e5-pawn should go else-
where. Kotov's 8 Bd3 is the nat-
ural reaction for White, intend-
ing to create threats on the di-
pecnss bi-h7 in the event of

.£7-£5.

The first link in Black's plan
of blockade: he brings a white
pawn to e4, which remains there
until the end of the game, ham-
pering any effort by White to
obtain the initiative on the di-
agonal where his queen and bi-
shop are so threateningly posted.
Meanwhile, he frees e5 for his
own pieces, and clears an im-
portant operating diagonal for
his "Indian" bishop, in the
event White castles long. For
all these advantages, Black has
only given up one pawn: an in-
significant price, considering
the circumstances.

The black knight wants to get
to e5, and White has to get it
out of there at any | cost, which
explains his knight's retreat to
its original square.


White saw nothing attractive
in the line 14 e5 N:e5 15 Brh7+
Kg8; although White keeps his
extra pawn and the semblance of
an attack on the king, his posi-
tion is actually quite hopeless,
in view of Black's threats of

Black has won the first skir-

White's pieces move out once
again to more active positions.

giving up a second pawn in order
to deprive the knight of the £3
square and expand the radius of
his blockade.

A classic example of a block-
aded position. The blockade's
immediate effect embraces four
white pawns, but its influence
penetrates much deeper: the
lightsquare bishop has been
turned into a pawn, the knight ' s
own pawns occupy all of its
best squares, and even so mobile
a piece as White's queen is al-
most totally blockaded as well!
Now Black threatens no more and
no less than mate in two; and
the best defensive move is ans-
wered, at last, by the well-
prepared breakthrough.


One can only marvel at the
great defensive power of White's
position, and at Kotov's mas-
terful ability to stay on his
feet come what may, considering
the circumstances.

172. Boleslavsky—Taimanov
(Queen’s Indian Defense)


Does White get the advantage
from his right to the first move?
Every chessplayer asks himself
that question, and the answer is
not easily discovered.


One is forcefully reminded in
this connection of Vsevolod Rau-
zer, one of our most noted mas-
ter-theoreticians, whose motto |
was, "1 e2-e4!, and White wins".
He was probably joking when he
said that, but every joke con-
tains its share of truth. This
conviction that moving the king's
pawn first gave White the bet-
ter of it, while 1 d2-d4 led
only to a draw, inspired Rauzer
to work out amazingly deep and
forceful attacking systems in
a number of openings: the Sici-
lian, French, Ruy and Caro-Kann,
and many others. Later, of course,
it developed that many of his


{291]


wins owed less to the objective
strength of his 1 e2-e4 than to
Rauzer's own creative talent,
the exceptionally logical pat-
tern of his thinking, and the
accuracy of his calculations.
Rauzer's Attacks and Variations
live on, and are still employed
to this day, even though it is
possible for Black to defend him-
self successfully against them.
So working up forcing lines for
use in the opening battle, a
fearsome weapon in the hands of
such players as Morphy, Chigorin,
Pillsbury, Alekhine, Fine and
Botvinnik, is a method that works
equally well for White or Black.
The player who uses a prepared
forcing line may very well run
into a forced refutation, as in-
deed happened in some games from
the present tournament. There is
no player, past or present, who
has never made a mistake — an
axiom that holds just as true for
home analysis as it does for
over-the-board play. Which, in
turn, means that one cannot, as
a rule, gain the advantage this
way in the opening.


So there exists a different
concept of opening strategy,
which may briefly be summarized
as follows: that it is not nec-
essary to make the very best
moves — only good ones.


This was the creative atti-
tude of Lasker and Capablanca,
for example, and it is Smyslov's
too. The advantage of the open-
ing, in this case, is understood
to be the right to choose a sys-
tem of development more suited
to the White player's taste, and
which gives him the greatest pos-
sible liberty to express his
creative ability.


Statistics —a sound approach
to the study of mass phenomena —
show that White's opening advan-
tage is quite real. In the var-
ious eras of history, in every
strong tournament for which rec-
ords were kept, White held a per-
sistent edge in the number of
wins. This advantage of White's
should be considered as a ten-~
dency, which manifests itself
in the course of dozens or hun-
dreds of games, but which has no
bearing on the outcome of any
particular game. It would be
tremendously interesting to ex-


amine this tendency in histori-
cal cross-section: has the per-
centage of games won by White
increased or decreased by com-
parison with what it was, say,
20, 50 or 100 years ago? One
peculiar feature should be noted:
the stronger the tournament, the
weaker the influence of the ad-
vantage of the first move. As
examples to demonstrate this, one
may cite the 1948 World's Cham-
pionship Match-Tournament, the
1951 World's Championship Match
(in which White won four games
and Black six), and a few other
events. Does this mean that even-
tually the right of the first
move will give no advantage at
all? Time will tell...


In this game, the reader will
find a sample of Boleslavsky's
well-prepared and accurately-
calculated opening play, followed
by a natural transition into a
combinative middle stage, and
then an interesting endgame which
is a win for White. In conclu-
sion, we have a witty counter-
combination by Taimanov.

7. Nbil-c3 Nf6-e4


In contrast to the King's In-
dian, where the placement of the
white e-pawn makes no difference
to Black, in the Queen's Indian
Black has to keep close watchon
the e4 square. The difference is
easily explained: in the King's
Indian, Black places his center
pawns on d6 and e5, leaving his
queen's bishop the excellent di-
agonal c8-h3 to work on, where-
as here the queen's bishop is
developed to b7, with a differ-
ent working diagonal, a8-hi. Con-
sequently, it follows that the
fewer pawns stand in the way
from b7 to £3, the better Black's
prospects will be. The next phase
of the game could be headed, "The
Battle For e2-e4", and it is Bo-
leslavsky who comes out the vic-


(292}


tor. Unlike Taimanov, he does
not forget his other option,
that of shutting the fianchet-
toed bishop out with d4-d5.


8. Qdi-c2 Ne4:c3
9. Qc2:c3 avers


White's second and third
"merely good" moves. Stubborn
attempts to secure an advantage
by means of 8 Bd2 or 9 be are
still being tried — although
the latter move does encounter
the powerful rejoinder 9..Nc6
(cf. Najdorf - Averbakh).

9. oe £7-£5

Opinions are sharply divided
over this fashionable move. It
is enough to note that some con-
sider it to be a defensive move;
others, attacking.


The author possesses a rather
limited knowledge of the Queen's
Indian, and although 9..f5 did
occur in the third and last en-
counter between the previous and
the present World Champions (Am-
sterdam 1938, Alekhine - Botvin-
nik), it would seem to me that
Keres is more correct in prefer-
ring the unhurried transfer of
this bishop to a better square
with 9,.Be4. In this opening
formation, the f-pawn probably
belongs at £7: the pawns at d/,
e6 and £5 overload the diagonal
c8-h3.

Of course, Black understands
that the knight does not belong
at c6; he is merely using that
square as a springboard to bring
the knight to the king's wing.
However, this costs Black ano-
ther move, which enhances White's
initial advantage.


With his advantage in time,
White methodically prepares,
and then carries out, the impor-
tant push d4-d5, cutting the
black bishop's mobility to nil.

White.

15. Qce2:b2 e6:d5


White's pawn must be removed

vented.

One can only describe Black's
position as "ailing". As you
can see, one need not make gross
blunders in order to lose a
game; sometimes it is enough
merely to have played the open-
ing superficially. Still, begin-
ning with this move, Taimanov
starts to play at full power,
demonstrating his customary re-
sourcefulness and invention.

Boleslavsky's combinative style
has one feature peculiar to him-
self: strict logic intertwined
with his tactical strokes. A
player of Smyslov's or Makogo-

played the more cautious 19 Rd2
followed by 20 Rfdi, and if
19..Re6, then the temporary re-
treat 20 Nd3.

And is that all? — the reader
asks. Yes, and that's not so
little, either. It is a well-
known truth that the importance
of a weakness increases as the
number of pieces on the board
decreases.


Here, White has at least three
advantages:


1) his bishop is active, while
Black's is not;


2) he can create a passed pawn
on the g- or h-file before
Black can create one;


3) he can also get his king to
the center more quickly.


These advantages are quite
sufficient to win.

clude that the simple 14 ab was
better, retaining a positional
advantage. This self-criticism
is commendable, but I do not
consider the move Stahlberg ac-
tually made in any way inferior


to 14 ab.

If White had been afraid to
lose, he could have continued

Having given up the exchange,
White ought to advance his passed
pawn as quickly as possible; for
this purpose the rook is better
placed at al, and the bishop at
f1. If Black can blockade the a-
pawn, he will probably have the
advantage.

The exchange of queens has
led to a difficult endgame, in
which the chances clearly lie
with Black, but the play is
very complicated, with eight
pieces wandering about the
board, any one of them capable
of surprises.


It is instructive to follow
the way both players try to
cut down the mobility of the
opposing pieces by tying them
down to the defense of weak
points. Black's rook and knight
are tied to the d-pawn, while
White's knight, bishop and rook
defend the pawn at a5, the pawn
at d5, and the knight at f5.
Black's king now approaches the
battlefield.

still able to achieve a draw.

A comparatively rare and not

he makes no secret of his wil-
lingness to exchange his light-
square bishop.

An unpinning technique, which

ther example of this technique
occurs with the black queen at
d8, the knight at £6, White's
bishop at g5 and his queen at
c3: Black plays ..Ne4, attacking
the queen with his knight and
also the bishop with his queen.

Toward the end of the tourna-
ment, the grandmasters began to
lose some of their inventiveness
in the openings. Here, Averbakh
repeats the opening of Game 39,
Bronstein ~ Euwe, which led toa
position rife with chances for
White. Euwe played 12..Re8 in
that game, hoping thereby to pre-
vent White's e3-e4 for some time;
however, it turned out to be
playable after all, since the op-
position of queens allowed White
to answer (after 13 e4) 13..ed
14 cd cd with 15 N:d4 (12..Qe7
is no more effective in this re-
gard). After Zurich, everyone
plays 12..Re8!, hoping for the
continuation 13 e4 c4!


13. d4:e5 Nc6:e5
14. Nf£3:e5 Qe7:e5
15. Rfi-el Bc 8-d7


Now the opening is over. The
advance e3-e4 remains the under-
lying theme for the present, but
there will be other themes as
well, for example: White's queen's
bishop is walled in by its own
pawns, and Black later sacrifices
a pawn in order to keep it impri-
soned; White no longer has his
king's knight, that sturdy de-
fender of the king's wing, which
inspires Euwe to devise and exe-
cute a sharp attack against the
white king. In general, Black must
be acknowledged to have solved
his opening problems successful-
ly; his last move (15..Bd7), how-
ever, is really a tactical trap,
and does not fit into the greater
plan: if now 16 e4, then 16..Ba4!
17 Q:a4? Q:c3. But Black's in-
tended kingside attack would have


become much stronger after 15..Re8,


intending to meet 16 e4 with
16..Ng4 17 £4 Qh5 18 h3 c4, ob-
taining good play. 16 Bb2 would


[299]


be met as in the game with
16..c4.

16. Bci-b2 c5-c4

A brave move, and a beautiful
one, too: White's c-pawn is
nailed down — he never does play
c3-c4 in this game — and even-
tually the white queen's bishop
falls without ever having at-
tacked anything. There is an
element of tactics here as well:
Averbakh must pay close atten-
tion to the diagonal c5-gi, since
a check by Black's queen at c5,
attacking the bishop on c4, could
prove most unpleasant for White.

In conjunction with his pre-
vious move, this is a bold and
original idea, marking Averbakh
as a genuine artist (it goes
without saying that deep calcu-
lation was necessary too). Many
would have fallen for the move


Najdorf recommends here, 20 Qd4,
but this leads to immediate de-
struction by 20..Qh5 21 h3 Bc6!
22 hg Q:g4, when Black wins the
queen for rook and minor piece.


20 Bd5 was tempting, but then
one of the symmetrical bishop re-
treats (to e6 or c6, £5 or b5),
combined with the threat of ..N:e3,
would probably have given Black,
if not the better of it, then at
least the opportunity to enter a
quiet endgame. Now, however, in
spite of Euwe's outstanding de-
fense, White maintains his extra
pawn.


20. eee Qc5=-b6


Black defends the rook, and
once again threatens ..Ba4, while
simultaneously hitting the bi-
shop.


21. Qd3-e2


White gets his queen out of
danger, defends his queen's bi-
shop, and attacks the knight,
forcing a quick resolution.


21. Sie Ng4:e3
22. Qe2:e3 Qb6:b2
23. Rei-e2 Qb2-b6!


Attack and defense are both
at their peak. Black brings
about an exchange of queens,
as if he did not see White's
threat of doubling on the d-
file, winning a piece. However,
this exchange is Black's only
means of holding the game: the
bishop does not fall, since
Black can attack White's bi-
shop with his rook and unpin
(25 Red2 Rc8).

So now it's an ending, in
which White has an extra rook's
pawn, but Black can attack it
from behind with his rook: such
endings are generally drawn, The
pawn is unable to advance with-
out the aid of the king; and in
the time it takes for the king
to get to the a-file, Black's
rook or king can pick off a
brace of kingside pawns. After
that, if worse comes to worst,
Black can always give up his
rook for the passed pawn.

177. Petrosian—Stahlberg
(Sicilian Defense)


This entire game is an excel-
lent illustration of Petrosian's
style: its highly individual
positional pattern and its logi-
cal consistency combine to create
a harmonious whole and an artis-
tic achievement. Curiously, not
one of the annotators of this game,
Stahlberg among them, could find
a single sizable error on Black's
part! The contemporary game oper-
ates on such fine nuances that
they prove difficult to isolate,
even in analysis, to say nothing
of over-the-board play.

The reader will doubtless have
noted that Petrosian is playing
a King's Indian Defense with the
White pieces. Defense against
what? The King's Indian is usu-
ally played in reply to 1 d4, but
here Black has not played the
corresponding 1..d5; his setup
looks more like a Dragon Sici-
lian. Thus, we are dealing once
again with our old friend the
clash of openings, in which both
sides arrange their pieces in


[301]


accordance with predetermined
schemes, and bide their time,
each occupying only his own
half of the board, without as
yet encountering the other.

Lulled by his opponent's appar-

initiates the conflict. This is
a serious inaccuracy, whereby
he weakens not only his king-
side, but the central squares
too. It would have been most
sensible for him to place his
queen on c7 (instead of c8), his
rooks on e8 and d8, and prepared
gradually for ..d6-d5.

Meanwhile, White could play
Rabi and b4, etc.; and with his
bishop working on the diagonal

serious threats to Black's
queen's wing. During all this,
practically the only thing the
knight on d4 would accomplish
would be to cover the weak pawn
on d3 from frontal attacks along
the d-file. This is why, instead
of the “strategic” ..Nd4, Black
selects the combinative ..Rfd8,
aiming directly at the d-pawn.

A series of subtle changes
has occurred. White's queen's
bishop has migrated to c5, where
it cramps Black's activities.
White's d-pawn has moved up a
square, but it remains just as
isolated, and therefore just as
weak, as it was before.


But is it really weak? It is
common practice to talk about


[303]


an isolated pawn's shortcomings
and neglect its positive aspects.
One such aspect is the absence
of pawns on the neighboring
files, which is a point for the
"isolated" side, as long as he
can bring his major pieces to
those files. And so it is

here: the absence of pawns on
the c- and e-files is clearly
not favorable to Black. The
queen, for example, stands quite
uncomfortably at c7, and the far-
reaching power of White's bi-
shops is also making itself felt.
Under these circumstances, Black
takes the only proper decision:
to attack and eliminate the d-
pawn supporting White's center
as quickly as he can.


18. a2-a4d e7-e6
19, a4-a5 Nd6-£5
20. ad-a6é Nf£6-d5


Black mistakenly stops half-
way. 20..b6 would have achieved
both of Black's goals by driving
the bishop from c5 and eliminat-
ing the d-pawn. After 20..b6
21 B:a8, Black would also have
had the pleasant choice of which
bishop he wishes to leave White;
I would have left him the dark-
square bishop, since after 21..R:a8
22 Ba3 N:d4& the position compli-
cates in a manner unfavorable to
White. However, the intermediary
22 Nb5 strengthens the defense,
so perhaps Black would be better
advised to take the other bishop:
21..be, and after 22 Bg2 cd he
has a strong passed pawn.


Then Black's pressure on the
b-file, combined with the ad-
vance of his d- and e-pawns sup-
ported by his fianchettoed king's
bishop, would have assured him
even chances, despite his small
material deficit. Boleslavsky se-
lects another, quieter continu-
ation, but it leaves the bishop
at c5 undisturbed, and creates
two new weaknesses for Black at
a7 and d5.

White's pressure is becoming
unbearable, so Black seeks to
exchange queens; however, this
should have cost him a pawn.


26. Qd3:b3 Rb8:b3
27. Ra4:a5 erete


The chief drawback of this ex-
changing operation is that it
costs White his most active
piece, that being the bishop at
c5. He could have maintained his
two bishops with 27 g4, which
would have led to the loss of a
pawn for Black in a considerably
inferior position: 27..Nh4 28 Be/7,
or 27..Nh6 28 h3, and the pawns
on d5 and a5 will not long sur-
vive.

White has now the very diffi-
cult task of queening his b-
pawn, a task rendered more com-
plicated by all those enemy
pieces on dark squares, where
they are very hard to drive out.
Now White's king will approach
the battlefield. Black decides
to enforce the exchange of the
last pair of minor pieces, which
completely immobilizes the b-
pawn.


30. ese Nd4-b3
31. Bd5:b3 Rb4:b3
32. Ra5S-a3 Rb3-b4


An interesting rook endgame,
and beyond doubt an instructive
one as well. White wants to ach-
ieve the following, if possible:
bring his king over to the b-
pawn, trade off one rook, and
not allow the black king to reach
his pawns.

The first part of the plan is

clever rook maneuver once again
throws White's king back to the
d-file.


39. Rf3-c3 Rc6-e6
40. Rce3-e3 Re6-c6+

The point of this move is to
break up White's pawn structure,
and most probably White should
have replied with the same pawn
advance: 42 g4. Of course, after
that Black could have maneuvered
. -Rc6-h6-f6-h6, to try to tie
one of White's rooks to the h-
pawn, but as long as White did
not swerve from his basic plan
of advancing his b-pawn, Black's
defense would still have been
very difficult. For example:

42 g4 Rh6 43 h3 R£6 44 £3 Rho

45 b4 R:h3 46 b5!, and if
46..Rb6, the king goes after the
rook.

Najdorf has, somewhat overcon-
fidently, allowed Black to dis-
member White's f-, g- and h-
pawns, resulting in the exposure
of White's king. Black's rooks
can now threaten to check on the
ranks as well as on the files,
and the black king's chances are
also greatly enhanced. In such
circumstances, it is hard to fix
your attention on any one thing
in particular, and so the pawn
at b3 takes only one more fodr-
ward step.

Black's clever defense has won
his pieces a great deal of activ-
ity. The fact that he no longer
blockades the b-pawn does not
mean at all that he is letting
it slip away from his attention.
Two rooks on the second rank are
a powerful force. Here, for exam-
ple, on 50 b5 there could follow
50..Rb2, when 51 Rfb4 is not play-
able due to 51..R:f2+. In addi-
tion, Black threatened 50..Ke5,
driving White's rook from f4,
which is the intersection of the
lines £4-b4 and £4-f2. White's
last move meets that threat,
since 50..Ke5 51 Rbf£3 would cost
Black the f-pawn.

The b-pawn cannot get far with-
out the king's help — but how
can he throw his f- and h-pawns
away? If he leaves them to the
black king, then even if he suc-
ceeds in queening his b-pawn,
Black will be able to give up
his rook at the queening square
and draw by keeping either his
f- or his h-pawn.

In Ragozin's Defense, the ab-
stract concept of White's open-
ing advantage assumes a concrete
form: the black knight stands in
front of the pawn at c7, which
Must sooner or later become the
target of an attack, and the d-
pawn remains artificially iso-
lated for some time. In return,
Black obtains what is referred
to as good piece play. There is
no disputing that in the eyes of
Schlechter, Teichmann or even
Rubinstein, the backward pawn
was something more substantial
than lively piece play, but in
our day the latter is more often
preferred.


Taimanov's next move initiates
a plan of gradually accumulating
small positional advantages.
First he secures control of his
open file.

Having squeezed as much as he
could out of his pressure on the

White switches to the e-file.

The immediate 24 e4 would not
have been effective, since the
black knight could go to d5.
White must create conditions such
that a trade of pawns on e4 will
lead to an immediate attack on
the black queen.
24, eee £7-£5

One more positional achieve-
ment. for White: Black's f-pawn
now hinders the mobility of his
own pieces, and the weakening
of the diagonal a2-g8 will make
itself felt later. On the other

Thus, White has achieved all
a positional player could ask
for. With lightsquare bishops
on the board, five of Black's
pawns stand on light squares;
White's knight occupies an ideal
position in the center, and can-
not be driven away; and Black's
pieces are tied down to defend-
ing the weak g- and c-pawns,
which stand on open files. If
only White could also occupy
the a-file with his rook!


What sort of attacking plan
should White select? Since his
opponent's weaknesses are fixed
on light squares, he should at-
tack the light squares, following
this rough scheme (and adjusting,
naturally, for his opponent's re-
actions): h2-h3, kh2, Rel and
g2-g4; or he can retreat his
queen and then play f2-f3 and
e3-e4. Taimanov's following
moves, £2-£4 and h2-h4, destroy
the possibility of a break-
through on the light squares,


and about three-quarters of
his chances as well.

Convinced that White has no
threats any more, Kotov takes
the game out of the realm of
chess and into that of psycho-
logy, inviting his opponent to
take the h-pawn, expecting some-
thing like this: 39 B:h5 R:b4
40 R:b4 Q:b4 41 B:g6 B:g6 42 h5
Qd6 43 Kf1, etc. — but even this
is hardly advantageous to Black,
especially as White also has
39 B:h5 R:b4 40 Rel.


It should be noted here that
this psychological experiment
owed its existence in large mea-
sure to the sporting situation:
had he won this game, Kotov
would have improved his tourna-
ment standing substantially, ov-
ertaking Keres and settling just
a half-point vehind Reshevsky.

39. Be2-di!! aes

A brilliant rejoinder. With-
out deciding yet whether or not
he will take the h-pawn, Taima-
nov forces the rook to declare
itself. If it abandons the a-
file, then he will take the pawn.
The position of the white bi-
shop, and its simultaneous ac-
tion against a4 and h5 are
strongly reminiscent of the pow-
ers of the king in Russian
draughts — could that be where
the bishop's move was taken from?

roundabout maneuver: first he
breaks on the queen's wing, and
only then does he go after the
king. The next few moves are
easy to understand, but this is
not a position amenable to pre-

the player who puts more fantasy,

If the reader ever has such a
position with White, he should
never accept a draw; and if he
has Black, he should never offer
one. White has the better posi-
tion. He may attack as he chooses,
on either flank, with good pros-
pects in either case. So why did
Reshevsky offer a draw? Obvious-
ly, he was making his own calcu-
lations: there remained three
rounds, with no charce for him
to take first, and second place
now seemed assured. Perhaps psy-
chology had something to do with
it, too, as well as arithmetic:
after all, the three previous
rounds had brought him only one
half-point...

The Four Pawns' Attack. This
variation has an interesting his-
tory. When it first appeared, it
struck terror into the hearts of
King's Indian players. By the
ageregate efforts of many mas-
ters, this attack's steamroller
tendencies were neutralized, and
soon it was Black who began to
score the points. The variation
disappeared for quite some time,
giving place to the more conser-
vative setups with g2-g¢3 and
Bg2, etc., or the "riskier" at-
tack with 5 £2-f£3, 6 Be3 and
7 Qd2.


Recently, the storming varia-
tion has reappeared, with new
aspirations and new goals, of
course, and decked out with an
array of modern positional
ideas.


In this game Black employs a
thirty-year-old defensive line
recommended by Alekhine. Not
surprisingly, the line has gone
stale since his day, and Black
saves himself only by calling a
timely halt to, and making some
alterations in, his originally
intended plan.


5. aaet e7-c5
6. d4:c¢c5 eee


This pawn used to be pushed to
d5, but praxis has shown the line
6 d5 0-0 7 Nf3 e6 8 Bd3 ed 9 cd
b5 to be acceptable for Black.


6. vee Qd8-a5
7. Bf1-d3 Qa5:c5

This is how the variation is
played nowadays. White has good
play for his pieces; unless
he is prevented, he will not
find it too difficult to put to-
gether a decisive mating attack.

The queen went to the kingside
in order to attack the bishop,
in the event that White castles,
with ..Ng4. The bishop could not
retreat to d2 then, in view of
12..Nd4! (using the well-known
technique of decoying both the
queen and the knight from the
defense of h2). However, White
does have a better move.


11. h2-h3 Nf6-¢4
12. Be3-d2! eae


Now Black must beat a sad re-
treat, so as not to suffer a
worse fate. From the course in-
dicated by his 10..0h5 and his
11..Ng4, one might logically
expect 12..Nd4 here, but then
the well-considered 13 Qf1!
would set Black insoluble prob-
lems.


Black's defensive system has
failed to justify itself.

Having suffered a fiasco on
the kingside, Black's knight
journeys to the queenside.
Black must be very careful, con-
tinuously calculating all the
variations beginning with f4-f5,
since his queen at h5 makes a
very tempting target for the
white minor pieces.

White straightforwardly im-

who has lost a great deal of
time on the maneuver ..Qa5-h5-
a5, is finding it most difficult
to come up with a plan of equal
value. The queenside diversion
he undertakes places his queen
in jeopardy once again, but it
turns out to be the only means
of maintaining the balance.
15..Qb4 is indeed the thread
which holds Black's game toge-
ther.

185. Geller—Taimanov
(Ruy Lopez)

Why is it that today — as com-
pared to ten years ago, let's
say — so few masters will go in
for fierce combinative attacks,
with piece sacrifices? More than
any other reason, it is because
the art of combinative defense
these days has reached such a
high level that in the heat
of the battle it occasionally
becomes difficult to determine
who is attacking whom. Of course
it's fun to crumble the defenses
of an opponent's king move by
move, to create irresistible
threats, and to wind up the game
with a mating attack. But how
sad it can be to end up minus
both piece and attack, to sit
and wonder:"How did all this
happen? Where did I go wrong?"


This is, roughly, the psycho-
logical backdrop of the Geller -
Taimanov game; but at the very
end, fortune favored the brave.


1. e2-e4 e7-e5
2. Ngi-f3 Nb8-c6
3. Bfi-b5 BE8-b4


In the Evans Gambit, White
sacrifices a pawn in order to
lure the black bishop to b4, so
that he can play c2-c3 and d2-
d4 with tempo. Here the bishop
is going to b4 of its own ac-
cord, and White can carry out
the same idea free of charge,
so to speak. Geller comes to an
unexpected conclusion: since he
is not required to sacrifice one
of his own pawns, he takes one


of his opponent's.

Bel-a3 Rf£8-e8
Qd1-h5 ets


White has decided to sacrifice
a piece for the attack. Natural-
ly, he has plenty of grounds for
this: the black king's knight has
been driven to a5, and the bishop
at b6 is also out of play. And
the combined force of the bishop
at a3, the rook on the f-file,
and the queen bodes nothing good
for Black's king. Nevertheless,
12 Nd2 first was better, since
complete success will never be
attainable without this knight.


12. ee £7-f£6

The further course of the game
will demonstrate that this move


should have lost by force.

The main line of Geller's com-

It was not his fault that Taima-
nov's sharp eye spotted and neu-
tralized this combination. On
the other hand, White still has
quite a few attacking possibil-
ities.

After 17 cd Q:d4+ 18 Nf£2 Nc4,
White's attack would come to a
swift and bitter conclusion. Now
17..B:e5 would run into 18 Neg5,
while after 17..Be3, the rook
occupies the d-file-with tempo,
creating boundless possibilities
for the attacker's fantasy in-
volving 19 Rf3 or 19 Rd3.

Once again, Taimanov finds the
best move.

two-pawns-vs-piece endgame. Fol-
lowing his Round 24 draw with
Reshevsky, Geller won three in
a row, and in the next round he
was to add a fourth — the longest
winning streak of the tournament.
This brilliant finish assured
Geller of a good place after his
disastrous start.

After his unhappy experience
with the opening as White in
Game 171, Kotov - Gligoric, in

switches to the more aggressive
continuation 8 g2-g4 and 9 h2-
h4, intending to break down the
black king's fortress at once.

The advantage of advancing


this pawn to £4 is that Black's
pieces are denied the square e5.
On the other hand, this move al-
so has serious drawbacks: Black
obtains a protected passed pawn
in the center, the darksquare
bishop is blocked, and White's
knight loses the £4 square.


Ngi-h3-£4, creating the ever-
present threat of sinking the
knight at e6 and also of a pos-
sible excursion to h5, was much
better.


12. steve b7-b5

Encouraged by his preponder-
ance in the center, Najdorf un-

15. Bfi:b5 Bc8=a6
16. Bb5:a6 Nb8 :a6
17. Ngi-e2 were


The threat of ..Na6-b4-d3+
forces White to castle hurriedly
on the short side, which means
that his main strategic idea —
an attack on the kingside — has
come a cropper. Now his whole
game looks dubious. Black's queen
can travel the Great White Way,
£7-h5-g4, to approach the ex-
posed white king, the d5-pawn
looks very lonely indeed, and
the white bishop has no pros-


pects. In such a position, an
extra pawn is small consolation.

White is willing to give up the
h-pawn without a check, but
Najdorf has other ideas.

And here's the idea! Now the
rook can no longer reach di, so
the d-pawn is defenseless. And
with the d5 outpost gone, Black
advances his pawn from d6 to d4,
and the game will end almost in-
stantly. Naturally, Kotov ob-
jects to such an immediate and
painful end; so with his usual
defensive resourcefulness, he
gives up an exchange for a pawn,
casting the game into a sea of
interesting complications. Naj-
dorf, who probably thought his
win would now be a matter of
technique, must begin the fight
all over again. Psychologically,
this is sometimes very difficult.

After 25..Ne6 26 Bb6 Rd7 27 Rf1

text move looks stronger, but it
allows Kotov an amazing resource

he continued his incautious play..

And now Najdorf is ready to

White's knights; then the e-pawn
will go on to queen — but as the
Eastern proverb has it:"If it
weren't for the wolves, our goat
could make it to Mecca." But now
two howling wolves appear, in
the form of a pair of white
knights...

From the diagram, one might
find it hard to believe that
there might be a chink in White's
position, and especially that
it might be at d5, which appears
to be his strongest point, rest-
ing as it does on two firm pil-
lars and immune to pawn attack.
In this position, however, a
combinative motif appears: by
means of a series of exchanges,
Black draws both of White's
rooks away from the defense of
his queen's bishop, and then the
c-pawn, which covers this bishop
on the file, can no longer play


its role as defender of the
d-pawn.

The pawns are fighting hand-
to-hand now. White's b-pawn per-
ishes, but the bastion at c6
holds firm, since the c-pawn is
immediately replaced by its com-
rade from b7.


White has succeeded in giving
his opponent a weak pawn on the
open c-file, but the rooks will
certainly never take it, provided
the cavalry can defend it from


his aggressive aspirations and
settles for a peaceable conclu-

attack. Black intended a pawn
sacrifice here: 14 ed £4!, open-
ing the queen's bishop's diag-
onal. Deciding that this would
be a dangerous line, White re-
captures with his knight, de-
spite the temptation to open
the e-file for his pieces.

By bringing this bishop out
to an active position, and then
obtaining his opponent's con-
sent to its exchange, Boleslav-
sky scores a weighty positional
success. In the Dutch Defense,
Black's lightsquare bishop is
considered bad (especially in
the Stonewall Variation), while
White's fianchettoed king's bi-
shop is the mainstay of his po-
sition. The exchange of these
bishops creates an unpleasant
situation around the white king.

[323]


In some openings — Alekhine's
Defense, for example, or the
Grunfeld — Black moves an un-
protected piece into the center
to induce the hypertrophied ad-
vance of White's pawns, intend-
ing to attack them later. Geller
here executes a similar idea in
the middlegame. He is trying to
induce White's pawns to advance
to £4 and to b3, which he soon
accomplishes. Later, he will work
up an attack against the pawn at
b3, for which purpose he will set
his rooks on the b-file and his
knight at c5, supporting the a-
pawn's advance to a4. The reader
should note that Petrosian was
unable to carry out the same idea
only because he had no piece that
could control the a4 square: the
queen, of course, is not aproper
piece for this purpose, and the
knight needs the square c5 —
which, as we saw, had been oc-
cupied by his pawn.

Despite the white knight's
threatening posture, and the
rather humble status of Black's
pawns, we consider Black's po-
sition preferable. The knight
will not keep its place on d5
for very long, while Black's
pawns harbor a great deal of
potential energy. White will
have trouble developing his
rooks, and his wing attack on
the kingside has fewer prospects
than Black's attack on the queen-
side.

Any queen retreat would have
allowed 9..c7-c5, when Black
has solved the two basic prob-
lems of the Catalan: the devel-
opment of his queen's bishop,
and counterattacking the pawn
at d4. After the exchange of
queens, further simplifications
quickly follow, and the game
winds up drawn. One must con-
clude, then, that the queen's
meanderings from dl to a4 to
c4 and back to a4 again, in
search of the sacrificed pawn,
were absolutely harmless to
Black.


Rapid development of White's
kingside (5 N£3) holds out more
promise. The c4-pawn would not
run away, and Black could not
try to hold on to it without
creating weaknesses in his posi-
tion.

Five pawn moves in a row!
Strictly speaking, one should
never play like this, but here
the white pawns’ inchworm pro-
gression is justified by the
introverted character of the
position. White wants to kill
three birds with one stone,
putting Black's knights under
threat of a pawn press, giving


[325]


his bishop an exit to g5, and
simultaneously closing off the
fianchettoed black queen's bi-
shop's diagonal.


However, all of these White
achievements would pale to in-
significance if Black would re-
call his own chances, particu-
larly against the chronically
sick pawn at c4.


So we can see that both sides
are entering the middlegame with
roughly even chances: everything
turns on which player handles
his pieces better.

this turn of events, but he
wishes to introduce a small but
substantial change: 15..h5. Now
the knight can only reach h5 by
capturing this pawn, and this
small detail changes the picture
completely: after White plays
N:h5, Black will have two attack-
ing lines, instead of one.

A knight usually stands well
at e5. Gligoric's attempt to
centralize his rook could have
resulted in an immediate loss.
However, saying that White com-
mitted an oversight is about the
same as saying nothing at all;
it is a great deal more inter~
esting to speculate on the causes
of White's oversight. During a
lengthy war of maneuver, it not
infrequently happens that one's
combinative alertness is dulled.
I think that this is precisely
what happened here, to both play-
ers.

33. sane Qe8-f£7

This is not like Keres; in
such cases, the commentator gen-
erally justifies the oversight
with "time-pressure". By trapping
the rook with 33. .Ned, Black
could have either forced 34R:e4
or captured the knight on g3,
since the knight could not leave

The queen finds a roundabout
route behind White's pawns.
White has dug himself in thor-
oughly, but Black's advantage is
of a lasting sort, expressed less
in the activity of his pieces
than in his better pawn position.
Specifically:


a) all of Black's pawns form a
single strand, while White" s
are broken into three “islands",
to use Botvinnik's expression;


b) the pawns at d5 and f5 se-
cure e4 for Black's knight; if
White should trade knights on
that square, Black gets a pro-
tected passed pawn;


c) if Black wins the a-pawn,
his passed a-pawn will queen
without opposition; the "“ready-
made" passed h-pawn cannot do
this, since the white pieces
are unable to clear its path.


These are the major features
of the position, and they serve
to explain why Black is con-
stantly on the offensive, while
White can only defend himself
passively. Under the circumstances,
White's defense must crack soon-
er or later.

Up to and including Black's
17th move, this variation is
well-known to theory. Here 18 g4
Nf£4 19 B:£4 ef 20 e5 is recom-
mended, and White wins a pawn
due to his threat of 21 Qe4.
Theory needs only a pawn ahead
to come up with its +, but that's
not quite enough for the chess-
player sitting at the board. It
is frequently possible to win a
pawn with such moves as g2-g4 or
..g7-g5, but how then does one
convert that pawn into a full
point?


In this instance, is 18 g4
justifiable? I think not. After
18 g4 Nf&4 19 B:f4 ef 20 e5, for
example, Black could play 20..Bb/7
21 Qe4 g6, and if 22 Q:f4 f6,
when the game opens up in a man-
ner clearly favorable to Black,


who is always assured of at
least a draw.


Such were the considerations
by which I came gradually to the
conclusion that 18 g4 was not
the move. However, I could not
allow a knight on £4, either.
Thus arose the move 18 g3; so
far as my memory serves, this
has never before appeared ina
tournament game.


Black, of course, cannot take
the h-pawn, since after 19 Ng5
White wins in all lines: the
bishop at h3 and the knight at
h5 are both en prise.

19 Ne3 B:h3 20 Nd5 was not

and will not rum away.

has created a passed pawn (al-

which in conjunction with his
two bishops represents a force
to be reckoned with.

Just as White feared, the knight

the knight would be trapped. The
proper reply for Black would be
38..Re5, when White could hardly
have hoped to exploit his mini-
mal advantage.


38. Stave Nd3:£2


Unexpected, and quite pretty.
If the knight is taken — which
is what White should have done —
the rook goes to the second rank
and picks up one of White's bi-
shops. Striving for a win at
all costs, White rejected this
variation in favor of a subtle
trap; then, holding his breath,
he waited to see if Reshevsky
would fall into it.

We are indebted to the Yugo-


slavs for the introduction of
this move to serious interna-
tional practice. White has to
decide here whether to push his
pawn to d5 or allow the black
knight to develop to c6 and
then drive it at once to a5. In
either event, the game will be
very interesting. Of course,
White's opening advantage will
not be neutralized immediately,
but Black has no need to fear:
although White does stand a bit
more actively, Black still dis-
poses of sufficient possibili-
ties for the most diverse cre-
ative efforts.


Among Soviet players, the Len-
ingrad grandmaster Korchnoi is
a virtuoso in this variation.

Reshevsky copies Euwe's play
in the latter's game with Sza-
bo. I do not think it proper to
allow Black to get in ..b/-b5 so
easily: 9 a4 might have been
played, even though this weakens
the b4 square — but how important
is that, if Black cannot extract
anything from it? On the other
hand, Reshevsky had played just
that move some days earlier
against Boleslavsky. And although
he obtained an advantage there,
he tries for more here — and
winds up with nothing!

If this knight had a chance of
reaching c6 later, then this re-
capture would be justified. But
since the variation 12..Ba6é 13Na5
N7:d5 14 Nc6 Nb4 is in Black's
favor, the pawn recapture would
have made more sense: d5 and b5
would have been more solidly de-

have turned out to be well
placed after all.

Black obtained a very good
game out of the opening, but
he is totally incapable of de-
ciding which side is the better
one from which to begin his as-
sault on the d5-pawn; thus he
continues to shuffle his pieces
back and forth. This sort of cat-
and-mouse play allows Reshevsky
time for a singularly favorable
regrouping, and then White can
give his opponent a little trou-
ble too. Gligoric ought to have
picked out a proper time to
bring his knight from c7 to d4;
instead, he drops it back to
e8 for some unknown reason, only
to bring it back out again.

Gligoric unexpectedly loses
his patience, and comes up with
a very dangerous plan to open
the game with ..e/-e6 — danger-
ous because, while the e-file
does fall into Black's hands,
the combination of ..Bh6 and
..e7+e6 hands White the impor-
tant diagonal al-h8 and the key
square f6. Later, Reshevsky takes
faultless advantage of this "gen-
erosity”™.

and yet it cannot be taken.

White threatened simultaneous
check to the queen and the king,
so the knight had to be removed.
Other lines would lead to still

instance: 26..Nfe8 27 Qc3 Bg?
28 Q:g7+ Nig7 29 Nf6+, or 26..Nf:d5
27 N:d5 B:d3 28 Nf6+, or, finally,

soon run out.

An old idea in a new setting.


In the final round of the 1935
Moscow International Tournament,
the 67-year-old Emanuel Lasker
destroyed Pirc's position right
out of the opening with a simi-
lar all-out attack, and received
a brilliancy prize for his play.
Keres carries out a similar idea,
but he is not following Lasker

so much as Tolush, who also em-
ployed 11 £5, not too long before
this tournament, in his game with
Taimanov in the Leningrad Champ-
ionship that year.


Na5:b3
Bf8-e7


11. Sie
12. c2:b3


One of the positional rules —
capture toward the center — is
being broken frequently of late.
In this position, the idea is
clear: to open the c-file for
the white rooks. However, in the
endgame, the disadvantages of
his pawn structure could cause
White considerable embarrassment.


Black must exercise some cau-
tion in completing his develop-
ment. Such moves as 12..b4, or
12..e5, followed by 13..b4, may
win the e-pawn, it is true; but
they contradict Black's strategy.
13. Ral-cl Qc? -d7

Here is Taimanov's prepared im-
provement. The continuation in
the Tolush - Taimanov game alluded
to was 13..Qb7 14 b4 0-0 15 fe fe
16 Qb3, with some pressure; here
Black covers e6 with two pieces,
and then quietly castles.

tion: he prepares ..e6-e5.

White must begin this series
of exchanges, since retreating
to g3 would mean going on the
defensive.

Keres may have hoped he would
have the time to secure d5 by
means of 19 Bg5, followed by
20 B:£6; only now did he notice
that 19 Bg5 loses a pawn after
19..N:e4 20 N:e7 Nig5 or 20B:e7
R:£5. So White takes the bishop
first, and then plays Bg5. And
to avoid finding himself in an
inferior position, he shores up
his e-pawn with a number of ex-
changes, attempting simultaneous:
ly to press his claim on the d-
pawn.

White has made no obvious er-
ror, but nonetheless the initia-
tive has gradually passed over
to Black. It appears evident


that attacking the e-pawn with
16 Qb3 took too much time, while


not giving White any real chances.


A different and more promising
plan was adopted by Geller in
his game against Taimanov from
the XXI USSR Championship. In-
stead of opening the f-file with
14 fe, he played 14 Qf3, contin-
uing his attack with g2-g4-g5.
It would seem that somewhere
along these lines the fate of
Taimanov's defense to 6 Bc4 will
be decided.


In the meantime, however, Ker-
es must find the simplest means
of neutralizing Taimanov's pres-
sure in the difficult endgame
that lies ahead. He decides to
give up his e-pawn for Black's
d-pawn, and to retain the heavy
pieces for play against the
passed (and "almost extra") e-
pawn.


24. Qb3-d1 Ra8-c8


Black does not fear the white
piece invasion of his eighth
rank: after the e-pawn falls,
it is White's king which will
be the first to come under a
mating attack.

Keres has managed to plug the
holes in his position by means

than to go into a queen ending
in which White has a useless
doubled pawn on the queenside.

A quick glance at this posi-
tion might leave one wondering
how even Keres, with all his
skill in queen endings, could
save this game. However, there
are two peculiarities in this
position which ease White's task
a bit: the black king's scanty
cover, which means White is al-
ways threatening a perpetual
check, and the solid position
of White's queenside pawns —
after all, they are three against


two! The meaning of this latter
circumstance will soon become
clear.
33. rae Qg6-g5+
33..Q£6 is useless, since
White would bravely proceed to
exchange queens, continuing —
not with 35 g4, certainly (which
would be good after 35..Kg6
36 Ke3 £5, but would be refuted
by 36..Kg5) — with 35 Ke3!,
which forces 35..f£5. After 36 24,
there would be very few chances
left, it is true, but they'd
all be White's.


34. Kd2-e2 Qg5-d5

This saves the game. All of
White's pawns turn out to be
placed precisely where they
are needed. If it were not for
the pawn at b4, 35..Qc5+ would
win; the b2-pawn defends the a3-
pawn, which would otherwise be
lost to 35..Qd3+.

35. sas Qd5-d3+

pawns at a3, b4 and c4 (or the
corresponding pawns at a6, b5
and c5). 18 ba would have been
met by 18..N:a5, attacking the
c=pawn down the file. Geller's
reply weakened the c5 square.
Black's knight heads for it im-
mediately, forcing White to take
it off next move. This helps,
but only by half, since Black
still has his other knight.


On 18 Qb3, White's queen would
remain tied to the defense of
the b-pawn, a circumstance which
Black could exploit by preparing
a kingside attack. Nevertheless,
he should not have weakened c5.

side (among other things, he
has covered d3 against a possi-
ble knight incursion from c5),
but he still does not have a
good defense for his c-pawn. So
he decides to sacrifice it.

White wants to sacrifice a
pawn for quick development. The
present position offers little
grounds to recommend such an
experiment: Black is well devel-
oped, and his king solidly pro-
tected. 7 Bg5 would have led to
some curious complications, for
example: 7..Qa5 8 Bd2 Nc5 9 Qc2

actively placed.

This refutes White's idea. If
the bishop had taken on c3 at
once, then White's development
after 10 be Q:c3 11 Bb2 would
be full compensation for Black's
extra pawn. Nor would the trade
of queens at b3 have hurt White,
since this would reunite the a-
and c-pawns. But now the queen


must move to c2, and the exchange


will take place under circum-
stances unfavorable to White.

The weakness at d4 can only

strictly speaking, now was the
time to start thinking about
exchanging queens. The varia-
tion 19..Qc5 20 Q:c5Nd:c5 seems
to meet the needs of the posi-
tion, since the knight on d7
goes to c5, and the threat of


the other knight to go to d4
would force White to keep a
knight posted at c2 to guard
that square. However, Reshev-
sky declined the queen trade,
since after 20 b4 ab 21 ab
Q:f2+ 22 K:f2 Black's mini-
mal advantage would not have
been sufficient to win.

This strong move equalizes

forced to accept the

here. It seems to me that the
American grandmaster committed
his mistake even before the
start of this game: he should
have chosen a different varia-
tion, or perhaps even a diff-
erent opening. The line that
occurred in the game was too
well known to Taimanov.

Alekhine played this as far

counterattack against the white
center Black removes White's
pawn from d4, and obtains the
possibility of settling down at
e5.

The battle is raging for d4.
However, this is not an end in
itself, since controlling the
square in front of an isolated
pawn is only important in those
cases where White can establish
a piece on that square and has
no weaknesses himself.


Black's further play is dir-
ected towards the enticement of
White's pieces as far as possi-
ble from d4, and the creation of
weaknesses in White's queenside
pawn position. For example, this
trade of darksquare bishops is
favorable to White, but Black
could not allow White to control
the long diagonal. And besides,
the white knight ends up in an
out-of-the-way location, from
which it would require at least
four moves to reach d4,.

deploy his knight to e6, where


it will hold a great deal of

White's plan of setting up a

with Rfel, Radi, Bbi, Ne5 and
£2-f£4 induces Black to start
this exchanging operation, re-
sulting in a lessening of the
number of pieces on the board.
Thus, the threat of an immed-

White's advantage remains, mere-
ly altering its form.

White's positional advantage
is indisputable. He may choose
between the advance of his a-
pawn to the fifth rank, perma-
nently nailing down the pawn at
b7, or an immediate attack with
£2-£4-£5, or the development of
his rooks to the d- and e-files.
All of these are good plans, ex-
cept that they are not forceful
enough, and allow Black the op-
portunity to put together a stout
defense. Szabo prefers to sim-
plify a little, leaving himself
one concrete advantage: pressure
on the open file against the
pawn at b7.

There was absolutely no reason

example: 33 g3 £4 34 Rd6 fe+

the advantage, but he would also
have had a difficult time coor-
dinating his attack on the b-

his king.


After the trade of queens that

up in a difficult rook ending.

Black's rook is tied to the
defense of the b- and d-pawns.
White wants to get his king to
£5 or e5; Black's next fewmoves
prevent this, but with them he
contracts a fresh weakness: the
pawn at f6.

After analyzing the adjourned
position, Kotov came to the con-
clusion that his position was
hopeless, and that his only
chance lay in activating his
rook.

Black has done everything pos-
sible: his king has broken in,
his rook is active, and the f-
pawn is now twice attacked. But
it's all too late: the d-pawn
will cost him the game.

Keres loves to play va bandue.
and does so with a great deal o


skill, especially at the end of
a tournament, when his final
standing is in the balance. One
can hardly help recalling the
last-round wins that secured
him first places in such strong
tournaments as the XV, XVIII,
and XIX USSR Championships, and
the 1952 Budapest International.


The word "tournament" probably
awakens in Keres visions of ar-
mored knights galloping towards
each other with lances at the
ready (and certainly not offer-
ing any draws!). Perhaps he saw
himself as just such a knight
When, in the final round, he
elected to try for clear second
place, and for the third time
adopted this double-edged wea-
pon, his new defense — or, more
accurately, counterattack — to
the Queen's Gambit. The risk
was very great, since his game
against Geller had already looked
dubious; and now Najdorf, who is
known to specialize in forcing
lines, would be well prepared,
beyond the shadow of a doubt.


8..a6 is an improvement on the
Geller -Keres game (No. 155), in
which 8..N:e4 was played.

This is better than castling
here, when Black could reply
10..de 11 Q:d8+ K:d8 12 Ng5 Ke8.
The text forces Black's bishop
to a passive position.

11..Be7 has been suggested in-
stead of the text. White might
have replied 12 d6 Q:d6 13 Q:d6
B:d6 14 Nc4, with the better
game, due to the weakness of the
black a- and c-pawns. Still,
this was better than 11..N:d5,
since Black could thereby have
avoided subjecting himself to
the perils of the direct attack
that now encircles his king.

A pretty piece sacrifice, with
the idea of keeping Black's king
in the center and attacking it
there with White's rooks, queen
and minor pieces. Keres has


caught a Tartar, indeed!
